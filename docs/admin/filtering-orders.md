You can quickly separate your POS and Online orders in the WooCommerce admin by using the quick-links to the top left. 
**Please note:** this will only filter POS orders after version 0.3.1, orders prior to 0.3.1 will default to Online.

Additionally, if you wanted to filter all the completed orders from your admin area so you can focus on the pending/processing orders, you can add the following code to your [functions.php](http://codex.wordpress.org/Functions_File_Explained) file.
