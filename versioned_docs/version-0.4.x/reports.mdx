This feature requires an upgrade to [WooCommerce POS Pro](http://wcpos.com/pro).
:::

export const Highlight = ({ children, color }) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: "2px",
      color: "#fff",
      padding: "0.2rem",
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">
  Facebook blue
</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
