## Hardware Compatibility

:::important Connectivity Requirements
This implementation uses Stripe's JavaScript SDK, which means it works through web applications but requires **internet-connected terminals only**. Bluetooth terminals are not currently supported.
:::

### Supported Terminals (Internet-Connected)
