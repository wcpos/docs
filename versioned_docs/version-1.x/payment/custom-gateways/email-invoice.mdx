## Usage

### Sending Invoices

1. **Add Items**: Add products to your cart in the POS
2. **Select Gateway**: Choose "Email Invoice" as the payment method
3. **Email Address**: 
   - For existing customers: Email is automatically populated from customer data
   - For guest orders: Enter the customer's email address manually
4. **Optional**: Check "Save to billing address" to update the customer's billing information
5. **Send Invoice**: Complete the process to send the invoice email

### Customer Experience

When you send an invoice, the customer receives an email containing:

- **Order Details**: Complete breakdown of items, quantities, and prices
- **Order Total**: Final amount due including taxes and fees
- **Payment Link**: Direct link to complete payment online
- **Order Information**: Order number and reference details

### Payment Completion

Customers can complete payment in two ways:

1. **Online Payment**: Click the "Pay for this order" link in the email
2. **In-Store Return**: Return to complete payment using other POS payment methods

The "Pay for this order" link takes customers to a dedicated payment page on your website where they can use any of your enabled web payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
