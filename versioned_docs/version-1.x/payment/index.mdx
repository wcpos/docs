WCPOS supports multiple payment methods to accommodate different business needs. The checkout uses an iframe/webview to load the WooCommerce Order Pay page, which means any payment gateway that works with WooCommerce can work in the POS.

## Default Payment Methods

The free version includes two built-in payment gateways:

### Cash

- Enter amount tendered
- Automatic change calculation
- No additional configuration required

### Card

- For use with external card terminals
- Simply mark the payment as complete after processing on your terminal
- No direct integration required

## Additional Payment Gateways (Pro)

:::info Pro Feature
Additional payment gateways require [WCPOS Pro](/getting-started/pro-license).
:::

With Pro, you can enable additional WooCommerce payment gateways in the POS checkout:

- **Stripe Terminal** - Direct integration with Stripe card readers
- **SumUp Terminal** - Integration with SumUp card readers
- **Any WooCommerce Gateway** - Enable any gateway installed on your store

## Enabling and Disabling Gateways

Payment gateways are managed in the WordPress admin:

1. Go to `WP Admin > POS > Settings > Checkout`
2. You'll see a list of all installed WooCommerce payment gateways
3. Toggle each gateway on or off for the POS independently of your online store
4. Drag to reorder — the first enabled gateway becomes the default at checkout

This means a gateway can be active on your website but disabled in the POS, or vice versa. See [Checkout Settings](/settings/wp-admin/checkout) for full details.

## Testing Payments

Before going live with a new gateway:

1. **Cash gateway** — always available for testing the checkout flow without real transactions.
2. **Stripe Terminal** — Stripe provides a [simulated reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/testing) for test mode. Enable test mode in your Stripe dashboard first.
3. **Third-party gateways** — check the gateway's own documentation for sandbox/test mode instructions. Most WooCommerce gateways support a test mode toggle.

:::tip
If a newly enabled gateway doesn't appear at checkout, try refreshing the POS. Gateway changes in WP Admin take effect on the next page load.

## Common Issues

### Gateway Not Appearing at Checkout

- Confirm the gateway is enabled for POS in `WP Admin > POS > Settings > Checkout`.
- Check that the gateway is also enabled in `WP Admin > WooCommerce > Settings > Payments` — a gateway must be active in WooCommerce before it can appear in the POS.
- Refresh the POS after making changes.

### Gateway Displays Incorrectly

The checkout iframe loads your site's theme styles, which can sometimes interfere. Use the **Checkout Settings** button in the checkout modal to selectively disable styles or scripts. See [Checkout Troubleshooting](/pos/checkout#checkout-settings-troubleshooting) for details.

### Payment Processing Fails

- Check your site's error logs (`WP Admin > POS > Support > Logs`) for gateway-specific errors.
- Ensure your SSL certificate is valid — most payment gateways require HTTPS.
- If using a staging or local environment, confirm the gateway supports test/sandbox mode.

## Custom Gateways

Create your own payment integrations using the [Custom Gateways](/payment/custom-gateways) system.
