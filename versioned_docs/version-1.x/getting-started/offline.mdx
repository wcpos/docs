description: What works offline in WCPOS, how the local database syncs with WooCommerce, and what happens when connectivity is lost.

WCPOS stores your product and customer data locally on each device using a browser-based database (IndexedDB). This means parts of the POS work without an internet connection, while others require connectivity.

## What Works Offline

- **Browsing products** — search, filter, and view product details from cached data
- **Browsing customers** — look up customer names, emails, and addresses
- **Building a cart** — add items, change quantities, edit prices, and apply POS discounts
- **Barcode scanning** — scan barcodes to find products in the local database
- **Viewing reports** — the default (offline) report type generates reports from locally stored orders

## What Requires a Connection

- **Completing checkout** — processing payment and creating the order in WooCommerce requires server communication
- **Applying coupon codes** — coupon validation happens on the server
- **Syncing data** — pulling new products, updated prices, or new customers from WooCommerce
- **Logging in** — initial authentication requires a connection to your WordPress site
- **Licence activation** — Pro licence checks need to reach the WCPOS licence server

## How the Local Database Works

When you first open WCPOS, it begins downloading your WooCommerce products and customers in the background. This process is progressive — the more you use the POS, the more complete your local data becomes.

The local database:

- **Persists between sessions** — data survives browser restarts and device reboots
- **Is per-device** — each device maintains its own local copy
- **Stays in sync** — WCPOS periodically checks for changes on the server and pulls updates

For more technical detail, see the [Architecture](/reference/architecture) reference.

## Connectivity Indicator

The POS header shows a coloured dot indicating connection status:

- **Green** — connected to the server, all features available
- **Yellow** — intermittent connection, some operations may be slow
- **Red** — offline, limited to browsing cached data

## What Happens During Connectivity Loss

If you lose your internet connection while using the POS:

1. **Products and customers remain browsable** from cached data.
2. **You can continue building carts** and editing items.
3. **Checkout will fail** if attempted — the POS needs to reach your WooCommerce server to process the order.
4. **Open orders are preserved** in the local database until connectivity returns.

## When Connection Restores

Once your connection comes back:

- The connectivity indicator turns green.
- You can proceed to checkout and complete any parked orders.
- Background sync resumes, pulling any product or customer changes that happened while you were offline.
- No manual action is required — WCPOS handles reconnection automatically.

## Tips for Unreliable Connections

- **Use "Save to Server" on important orders** — this pushes the order to WooCommerce immediately, so it's not lost if the device's local database is cleared.
- **Sync regularly** — if you know connectivity is intermittent, sync your product catalogue while you have a good connection so local data is up to date.
- **Consider the native apps** — the desktop and mobile apps (when available) can offer better offline resilience than the browser version.
