## Connect Screen Overview

When you open the WCPOS Desktop or Mobile app, you'll see the Connect screen. This is where you manage your store connections and user logins.

## Adding a New Store

1. Enter your WooCommerce store URL in the text field (e.g., `https://mystore.com`)
2. Click **Connect**
3. You'll be redirected to log in with your WordPress credentials
4. After successful login, you'll be returned to the app

## Multiple Stores

You can connect to as many WooCommerce stores as you need. Each store appears as a separate card on the Connect screen, showing:

- **Store name** and favicon
- **Store URL**
- **Logged in users** for that store

This is useful if you manage multiple locations or businesses.

## Multiple Users Per Store

Each store can have multiple users logged in simultaneously. This is helpful for:

- **Shift changes** - New cashier can log in before the previous one logs out
- **Multi-register setups** - Different cashiers on different devices
- **Quick switching** - Easily switch between user accounts

### Adding a User

Click the **+** button next to "Logged in users" to add another user to that store.

### Switching Users

Click on a user badge (e.g., "Brenda") to open the POS as that user.

### Removing a User

Click the **×** on a user badge to log that user out of the store.

## Removing a Store

Click the red **×** button on the store card to remove it from your list. This logs out all users and removes the store connection from the app.

## Demo Store

At the bottom of the screen, you may see an "Enter Demo Store" link. This connects you to a demo WooCommerce store to try out WCPOS features without affecting your own store data.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to my store?

- Ensure the WCPOS plugin is installed and activated on your WordPress site
- Check that you're using the correct URL (include `https://` if your site uses SSL)
- Verify that the WooCommerce REST API is accessible
- Check that your user account has POS access permissions

### Connection keeps failing?

- Try accessing `yourdomain.com/pos` in a web browser first to verify the plugin is working
- Check your site's error logs for any issues
- Ensure your server meets the [minimum requirements](/getting-started/installation)
