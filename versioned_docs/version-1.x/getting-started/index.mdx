## What is WCPOS?

WCPOS is a Point of Sale (POS) system for WooCommerce. It allows you to sell products from your WooCommerce store in-person, at a physical location, using a web browser or dedicated app.

**Available on:**

- **Web:** Access instantly at `yourdomain.com/pos`
- **Desktop:** [Windows](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/win32-x64), [Mac (Intel)](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/darwin-x64), [Mac (Apple Silicon)](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/darwin-arm64)
- **Mobile:** [iOS (TestFlight)](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JGBdVRrW) and [Android (Google Play Beta)](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.wcpos.main)

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Install the Plugin

Install the free [WCPOS plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pos/) on your WordPress site:

1. Go to `WP Admin > Plugins > Add New`
2. Search for "WooCommerce POS"
3. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**

See [Installation](/getting-started/installation) for detailed requirements.

### 2. Access the POS

**Web Users:**
Navigate to `yourdomain.com/pos` in your browser. You'll be prompted to log in with your WordPress credentials.

**Desktop/Mobile Users:**
1. Download the app: [Windows](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/win32-x64), [Mac (Intel)](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/darwin-x64), [Mac (Apple Silicon)](https://updates.wcpos.com/electron/download/darwin-arm64), [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JGBdVRrW), or [Android](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.wcpos.main)
2. Enter your store URL and click **Connect**
3. Log in with your WordPress credentials

See [Connect](/getting-started/connect) for details on managing multiple stores and users.

### 3. Wait for Initial Sync

WCPOS downloads products in small batches (around 50 at a time) to avoid overloading your server. Products are progressively downloaded as you search, scroll, or filter—you don't need to wait for everything to sync before you start selling. See [Product Synchronisation](/products/sync) for details.

### 4. Start Selling

- Search or scan products to add them to the cart
- Select a customer or use "Guest"
- Click **Checkout** to process payment
- Print or email the receipt

## Key Features

- **Fast local search** - Products are stored locally for instant results
- **Offline browsing** - Search products and customers without internet (completing orders requires connectivity)
- **Barcode scanning** - Use any USB or Bluetooth barcode scanner
- **Multiple payment methods** - Cash, card, and custom gateways
