## Report Types

### Default (Offline)

The default report is generated from locally stored data. This:

- Works without server connection
- Provides fast report generation
- Uses data already synced to the device

This is ideal for quick end-of-day summaries where all relevant orders are already synced.

## End-of-Day Workflow

### Typical Daily Reconciliation

1. **Set date range** - Select "Today" or the specific date
2. **Filter by cashier** (optional) - For individual cashier reports
3. **Review orders** - Check the orders table for accuracy
4. **Verify totals** - Compare with physical cash count and card terminal
5. **Print report** - Generate a physical record

### Cash Reconciliation

1. Filter to show only cash payments
2. Note the total cash amount from the report
3. Count physical cash in the drawer
4. Compare totals (should match)
5. Document any discrepancies

### Card Reconciliation

1. Filter to show only card payments
2. Note the total card amount from the report
3. Compare with your card terminal's batch total
4. Verify amounts match before settling the batch
