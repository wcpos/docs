# DB01001: Connection Failed

## What This Means

The POS could not connect to its local database. WCPOS uses a local database to store products, customers, and other data for fast access and offline functionality.

## Common Causes

- **Storage full** — Device has no storage space left
- **Database corrupted** — Local database files are damaged
- **Permission issue** — App doesn't have storage permissions
- **Browser storage disabled** — IndexedDB is disabled (web version)

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Storage Space

Ensure your device has available storage:
- Free up space if storage is full
- Delete unused apps or files
- Check available disk space

### 2. Clear App Data

Reset the local database:
- **Desktop app:** Look for "Clear Data" in settings
- **Web browser:** Clear site data for the POS domain
- **Note:** This will require re-syncing all data

### 3. Check Browser Settings (Web)

If using the web version:
1. Ensure IndexedDB is enabled
2. Don't use private/incognito mode (limited storage)
3. Allow the site to store data

### 4. Check Permissions

On desktop:
- Ensure the app has permission to write to its data directory
- Check if antivirus is blocking database access

### 5. Reinstall the App

If other solutions fail:
1. Uninstall the POS app
2. Restart your device
3. Reinstall the app
4. Login and sync data

## Data Recovery

If you have unsaved data:
- The app may have pending changes that couldn't be synced
- Contact support if you need help recovering data
- In most cases, data can be re-synced from the server
