# DB02001: Duplicate Record

## What This Means

The database tried to insert a record with an ID that already exists. Each record must have a unique identifier.

## Common Causes

- **Sync conflict** — Same data synced twice
- **Race condition** — Multiple operations creating same record
- **Data corruption** — IDs were corrupted or duplicated
- **Import issue** — Importing data that already exists

## How to Fix

### 1. Refresh Data

Re-sync from the server:
- Pull latest data
- Let the sync process resolve conflicts
- The newer data should take precedence

### 2. Retry the Operation

If creating new records:
- The system may have already created it
- Check if the record exists
- Avoid clicking submit multiple times

### 3. Clear Local Cache

Reset local data:
1. Clear the local database/cache
2. Login again
3. Sync data fresh

### 4. Check for Duplicates in WooCommerce

If the issue persists:
- Check WooCommerce for duplicate entries
- Look for products/orders with same IDs
- Clean up any duplicates in the admin

### 5. Report Persistent Issues

If this happens frequently:
- Note what actions cause it
- Check for patterns
- Report to support with details

## Why This Matters

Duplicate IDs would cause:
- Confusion about which record is correct
- Data overwrites
- Sync issues

The error prevents data corruption.
