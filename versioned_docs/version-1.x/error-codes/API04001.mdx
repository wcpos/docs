# API04001: Invalid Response Format

## What This Means

The server responded, but the response format is not what the POS expected. The server should return JSON data, but something else was received.

## Common Causes

- **PHP error displayed** — A PHP error is being output before JSON
- **Plugin conflict** — Another plugin is outputting content
- **Maintenance mode** — Site is showing a maintenance page
- **Wrong content type** — Server sending HTML instead of JSON
- **Caching issue** — A cached error page is being served

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Your Site

Visit your WordPress site in a browser:
- Is it displaying normally?
- Are there any visible errors?
- Is it in maintenance mode?

### 2. Check for PHP Errors

In `wp-config.php`, temporarily enable debugging:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
```

Check `wp-content/debug.log` for errors.

### 3. Test the REST API Directly

Visit `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/` in your browser:
- Should return JSON data
- If you see HTML or errors, there's a problem
- Check for plugin-related output

### 4. Disable Caching Temporarily

Caching plugins may serve stale responses:
- Clear all caches
- Temporarily disable caching plugins
- Exclude the REST API from caching

### 5. Check for Plugin Conflicts

If a plugin outputs content on every page:
1. Disable all non-essential plugins
2. Test the POS
3. Re-enable plugins one by one
