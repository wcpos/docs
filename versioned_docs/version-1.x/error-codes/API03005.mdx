# API03005: Rate Limit Exceeded

## What This Means

You've made too many requests to the server in a short period. Rate limiting protects the server from being overwhelmed.

## Common Causes

- **Rapid sync operations** — Multiple devices syncing simultaneously
- **Aggressive refresh** — Refreshing data too frequently
- **Security plugin** — A plugin is enforcing request limits
- **Hosting limits** — Your hosting plan has API rate limits

## Server Error Mapping

This error code is triggered when the server returns:

| Server Code | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| HTTP 429 | Any server response (fallback) |

## How to Fix

### 1. Wait and Retry

Rate limits are temporary:
- Wait 1-5 minutes
- The POS will automatically retry
- Avoid manually refreshing repeatedly

### 2. Reduce Concurrent Operations

If using multiple POS terminals:
- Stagger initial sync across devices
- Avoid refreshing all devices at once
- Let one complete before starting another

### 3. Check Security Plugins

Plugins like Wordfence may block rapid requests:
- Whitelist the POS application
- Whitelist your POS device IPs
- Adjust rate limiting thresholds

### 4. Review Hosting Limits

Some hosts limit API requests:
- Check your hosting plan details
- Consider upgrading if limits are too low
- Contact support about increasing limits

### 5. Optimize Sync Frequency

In POS settings:
- Adjust auto-refresh intervals
- Use manual sync when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary data refreshes
