# API01004: DNS Resolution Failed

## What This Means

The POS could not convert your website's domain name (e.g., `yourstore.com`) into an IP address. DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phone book — if it can't find the listing, it can't make the connection.

## Common Causes

- **Typo in domain name** — The URL may have a spelling error
- **DNS server issues** — Your DNS server is not responding
- **Domain expired** — The domain registration may have lapsed
- **DNS propagation** — Recent DNS changes haven't propagated yet
- **Local DNS cache** — Outdated DNS information cached on your device

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify the Domain Name

Double-check the URL for typos. Try accessing the site in a browser.

### 2. Check Domain Status

Use a WHOIS lookup to verify:
- The domain is still registered
- It hasn't expired
- DNS records are configured

### 3. Clear DNS Cache

**On your device:**

macOS:
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

Windows:
```bash
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### 4. Try Alternative DNS

Switch to a public DNS server like:
- Google: `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`
- Cloudflare: `1.1.1.1`

### 5. Wait for DNS Propagation

If you recently changed DNS settings, wait 24-48 hours for full propagation.
