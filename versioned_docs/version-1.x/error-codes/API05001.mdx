# API05001: WooCommerce API Disabled

## What This Means

The WooCommerce REST API is disabled on your site. WCPOS requires the REST API to communicate with WooCommerce and access store data.

## Common Causes

- **WooCommerce setting** — The REST API was intentionally disabled
- **Security plugin** — A security plugin is blocking API access
- **Hosting restriction** — Your host has disabled REST API access
- **Permalink issues** — Permalinks not configured for REST API

## How to Fix

### 1. Enable WooCommerce REST API

In WordPress Admin:
1. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API
2. Ensure the REST API is enabled
3. Verify API keys are created

### 2. Check WordPress REST API

The WooCommerce API depends on WordPress REST API:
1. Visit `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/` in your browser
2. Should return JSON data
3. If not, see [API05004](./API05004)

### 3. Check Security Plugins

Common security plugins that may block the API:
- **Wordfence** — Check firewall settings
- **iThemes Security** — Check REST API settings
- **All In One WP Security** — Review firewall rules

Whitelist REST API endpoints or the POS application.

### 4. Check .htaccess

Look for rules blocking API access:

```apache
# Remove or modify rules blocking /wp-json/
# Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled
```

### 5. Flush Permalinks

Sometimes permalink settings need refreshing:
1. Go to Settings → Permalinks
2. Click "Save Changes" (even without making changes)
3. This regenerates rewrite rules
