# SY01002: Disk Full

## What This Means

Your device's storage is full. The POS cannot save data or continue operating without available disk space.

## Common Causes

- **Storage full** — No free space on the drive
- **Large local database** — POS data using significant space
- **Temp files** — Temporary files consuming space
- **Other applications** — Other apps filling the disk

## How to Fix

### 1. Free Up Disk Space

Delete unnecessary files:
- Empty the trash/recycle bin
- Remove old downloads
- Delete unused applications
- Clear temporary files

### 2. Check Available Space

**Windows:**
- Open File Explorer
- Right-click the drive → Properties
- View used and free space

**macOS:**
- Apple menu → About This Mac
- Click Storage

### 3. Clear Browser Data (Web Version)

Browsers store data locally:
- Clear cache and cookies
- Remove old site data
- Check browser storage usage

### 4. Move or Delete Large Files

Find and handle large files:
- Old videos or photos
- Large downloads
- Unused software
- Backup files that can be moved to external storage

### 5. Check POS Data

If POS data is very large:
- The local database may need cleaning
- Consider clearing and re-syncing
- Check if old data can be purged

## Recommended Free Space

Keep at least:
- **10GB** free for normal operation
- **20GB+** for large catalogs
- More space is always better

## Preventing Future Issues

- Regularly clean up unnecessary files
- Set up automatic temp file cleanup
- Monitor disk space usage
- Consider larger storage if frequently full
