# PY01004: Invalid Card Number

## What This Means

The card number entered is not valid. Card numbers follow specific patterns and include check digits for validation.

## Common Causes

- **Typo** — One or more digits entered incorrectly
- **Missing digits** — Not all digits were entered
- **Extra digits** — Too many digits entered
- **Wrong card** — Different card number than physical card
- **Card reader error** — Chip/swipe read the wrong data

## How to Fix

### 1. Re-enter the Card Number

Carefully enter all digits:
- Check the physical card
- Enter each digit slowly
- Verify the full number before submitting

### 2. Check Card Type

Ensure the card type is supported:
- Visa (starts with 4)
- Mastercard (starts with 51-55 or 22-27)
- Amex (starts with 34 or 37)
- Discover (starts with 6011, 622, 644-649, 65)

### 3. Try Again with Card Reader

If using a chip/swipe reader:
- Clean the card chip
- Try a different read method (chip vs swipe)
- Manually enter if reader fails

### 4. Use a Different Card

If the card number continues to fail:
- The card may be damaged
- Try a different card
- Use an alternative payment method

### 5. Check for Card Damage

Physical card issues:
- Scratched magnetic stripe
- Damaged chip
- Worn or faded numbers
- Card may need replacement
