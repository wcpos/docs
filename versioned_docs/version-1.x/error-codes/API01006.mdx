# API01006: Network Unreachable

## What This Means

The POS cannot establish a route to the server. This is a network-level issue — the data packets can't find a path to your server.

## Common Causes

- **Network configuration issues** — Incorrect gateway or routing settings
- **ISP problems** — Your internet service provider is having issues
- **VPN interference** — A VPN may be routing traffic incorrectly
- **Server network issues** — The server's network may be down

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Your Internet Connection

- Try accessing other websites
- Restart your router/modem
- Verify you're connected to the network

### 2. Disable VPN Temporarily

If using a VPN:
- Disconnect and try again
- Try a different VPN server
- Check if the VPN allows access to your server's location

### 3. Check with Your ISP

Contact your internet service provider if:
- Other sites are also unreachable
- The issue persists after restarting network equipment

### 4. Verify Server Status

- Check if your hosting provider reports any network issues
- Try accessing your site from a different network (e.g., mobile data)
- Use online tools to check if the site is down for everyone

### 5. Check Firewall Settings

Ensure your device's firewall isn't blocking outgoing connections to your server.
