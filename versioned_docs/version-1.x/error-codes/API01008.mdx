# API01008: Website Unavailable

## What This Means

The POS can reach the internet, but your specific website is not responding. The server hosting your WooCommerce store appears to be down or unreachable.

## Common Causes

- **Server maintenance** — Your hosting provider may be performing updates
- **Server crash** — The web server has stopped unexpectedly
- **Resource limits exceeded** — Your hosting account hit its limits
- **DDoS attack** — The server is overwhelmed by malicious traffic
- **Domain/hosting expired** — Your hosting or domain has lapsed

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify the Site is Down

Try accessing your site directly in a browser. If it doesn't load, the issue is server-side.

### 2. Check Hosting Provider Status

- Visit your hosting provider's status page
- Check for scheduled maintenance
- Look for reported outages

### 3. Review Hosting Account

Log into your hosting control panel:
- Check if your account is active
- Verify you haven't exceeded resource limits
- Look for any suspension notices

### 4. Contact Hosting Support

If everything looks normal on your end, contact your hosting provider. They can:
- Check server status
- Review server logs
- Restart services if needed

### 5. Wait and Retry

If it's a temporary outage:
- Wait 15-30 minutes
- The POS will automatically retry connections
- Cached data remains available offline
