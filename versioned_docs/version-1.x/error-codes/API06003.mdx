# API06003: Invalid Site Configuration

## What This Means

The site configuration is invalid or incomplete. This could involve incorrect URLs, authentication settings, or other configuration issues.

## Common Causes

- **Partial configuration** — Some settings are missing
- **Mismatched settings** — Configuration doesn't match the site
- **Corrupted configuration** — Settings were corrupted
- **Site changes** — The site was modified without updating POS config

## How to Fix

### 1. Review All Settings

Check the complete configuration:
- Site URL is correct
- Authentication is properly configured
- Any additional settings are correct

### 2. Reconfigure from Scratch

If configuration is corrupted:
1. Clear all stored settings
2. Start the setup process again
3. Enter fresh configuration

### 3. Check Site Requirements

Verify your WordPress site meets requirements:
- WordPress is installed and accessible
- WooCommerce is installed and active
- WCPOS plugin is installed and active
- Permalinks are enabled (not "Plain")

### 4. Test Site Access

Verify these URLs work in a browser:
- `https://yoursite.com/` — Main site
- `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/` — REST API
- `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/wcpos/v1/` — WCPOS API

### 5. Check WordPress Settings

In WordPress Admin:
1. Settings → General — Verify URLs
2. Settings → Permalinks — Ensure not "Plain"
3. WooCommerce → Status — Check for issues

## Configuration Requirements

A valid configuration needs:
- **Site URL** — Full URL with protocol
- **Authentication** — Valid credentials or API keys
- **Permissions** — User has POS access
- **Plugins** — Required plugins are active
