# API02006: API Key Invalid

## What This Means

The WooCommerce REST API key being used is invalid. API keys are used for server-to-server authentication, and the key provided doesn't match any valid key in WooCommerce.

## Common Causes

- **Key deleted** — The API key was removed from WooCommerce
- **Key typo** — The key was entered incorrectly
- **Wrong key pair** — Consumer key and secret don't match
- **Key from different site** — Using keys generated for another installation

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify the API Key

In WordPress Admin → WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API:
1. Check if your API key exists
2. Verify it hasn't been revoked
3. Note the permissions (read/write/read-write)

### 2. Generate New API Keys

If the key is missing or invalid:
1. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API
2. Click "Add key"
3. Enter a description (e.g., "WCPOS")
4. Select the user
5. Choose "Read/Write" permissions
6. Click "Generate API key"
7. **Copy both the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret** (shown only once!)

### 3. Update POS Configuration

Enter the new API keys in the POS:
- Consumer Key (starts with `ck_`)
- Consumer Secret (starts with `cs_`)

### 4. Check Key Permissions

Ensure the key has sufficient permissions:
- **Read** — View data only
- **Write** — Modify data only
- **Read/Write** — Full access (recommended for POS)
