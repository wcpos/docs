# API02009: Refresh Token Expired

## What This Means

Your refresh token has exceeded its lifetime and can no longer be used to obtain new access tokens. Unlike access tokens (which expire quickly), refresh tokens typically last days or weeks but do eventually expire.

## Common Causes

- **Extended inactivity** — You haven't used the POS for a long time
- **Short token lifetime** — Server configured with short refresh token expiration
- **Clock skew** — Device or server time is significantly off

## How to Fix

### 1. Log In Again

When the refresh token expires, you must authenticate again:
1. Log out of the POS
2. Enter your credentials
3. A new refresh token will be issued

### 2. Use POS Regularly

To avoid this in the future:
- Use the POS regularly to keep tokens fresh
- Tokens are refreshed automatically when you're active
- Extended periods of inactivity will require re-login

### 3. Check Time Settings

Ensure accurate time on all systems:
- Enable automatic time sync on your device
- Verify server time is correct
- Time differences can cause premature expiration

### 4. Adjust Token Lifetime (Advanced)

If tokens expire too quickly for your needs, a server administrator can adjust the refresh token lifetime in the authentication settings.
