# DB02002: Record Not Found

## What This Means

The requested record does not exist in the local database. The POS tried to access a product, customer, order, or other record that isn't stored locally.

## Common Causes

- **Not yet synced** — Data hasn't been downloaded yet
- **Deleted on server** — Record was removed in WooCommerce
- **Sync not complete** — Initial sync is still running
- **Filter applied** — Record excluded by active filters

## How to Fix

### 1. Wait for Sync

If recently started:
- Wait for initial sync to complete
- Check sync progress indicator
- The record should appear once synced

### 2. Refresh/Re-sync

Trigger a data refresh:
- Use the refresh/sync button (<Icon name="arrow-rotate-right" />) - short press for sync
- **Long press** the sync button for Clear and Refresh option
- Pull latest data from server
- Wait for completion

### 3. Check WooCommerce

Verify the record exists on the server:
- Log into WordPress Admin
- Check Products, Orders, or Customers
- Confirm the item still exists

### 4. Check Filters

The record might be filtered out:
- Review active filters in the POS
- Check category filters
- Verify visibility settings

### 5. Clear and Re-sync

If sync seems stuck:
1. Clear local data
2. Login again
3. Complete a fresh sync

## Common Scenarios

- **Product not showing:** Check if it's published and visible
- **Customer not found:** May not have been synced yet
- **Order missing:** Could be outside the sync date range
