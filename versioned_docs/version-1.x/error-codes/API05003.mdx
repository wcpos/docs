# API05003: WCPOS Plugin Outdated

## What This Means

The WCPOS plugin installed on your server is outdated and not compatible with your version of the POS application. You need to update the plugin.

## Common Causes

- **Plugin not updated** — Auto-updates may be disabled
- **Update failed** — A previous update attempt failed
- **Version mismatch** — POS app updated but plugin wasn't
- **Staging/dev site** — Testing on an older version

## How to Fix

### 1. Update the Plugin

In WordPress Admin:
1. Go to Plugins → Installed Plugins
2. Find "WooCommerce POS"
3. If an update is available, click "Update Now"

### 2. Enable Auto-Updates

To prevent future mismatches:
1. Go to Plugins → Installed Plugins
2. Find "WooCommerce POS"
3. Click "Enable auto-updates"

### 3. Manual Update

If automatic update fails:
1. Download the latest version from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pos/)
2. Deactivate the current plugin
3. Delete the old plugin files
4. Upload and activate the new version

### 4. Check for Update Errors

If updates are failing:
- Check file permissions on wp-content/plugins
- Verify you have disk space
- Look for PHP memory issues
- Check error logs for details

### 5. Downgrade POS App (Temporary)

If you can't update the plugin immediately:
- Use an older version of the POS app
- This is a temporary workaround only
- Plan to update the plugin soon

## Version Compatibility

Always keep both components updated:
- The POS application
- The WCPOS WordPress plugin

Check release notes for any breaking changes when updating.
