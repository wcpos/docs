# API01005: SSL Certificate Error

## What This Means

There's a problem with your website's SSL/TLS certificate. This certificate is what makes the connection secure (HTTPS). The POS won't connect to sites with invalid certificates to protect your data.

## Common Causes

- **Expired certificate** — SSL certificates need to be renewed periodically
- **Self-signed certificate** — Not issued by a trusted authority
- **Wrong domain** — Certificate doesn't match the domain name
- **Incomplete certificate chain** — Missing intermediate certificates
- **Mixed content** — Some resources loaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Certificate Status

Visit your site in a browser and click the padlock icon to view certificate details. Look for:
- Expiration date
- Issued to (should match your domain)
- Issued by (should be a recognized authority)

### 2. Renew Expired Certificate

If expired:
- Most hosting providers offer free Let's Encrypt certificates
- Contact your hosting provider to renew
- Check if auto-renewal is enabled

### 3. Fix Certificate Mismatch

Ensure the certificate covers:
- Your exact domain (`yourstore.com`)
- WWW variant (`www.yourstore.com`) if used
- Consider a wildcard certificate (`*.yourstore.com`)

### 4. Install Missing Intermediate Certificates

Use an SSL checker tool (like SSL Labs) to identify missing certificates. Your hosting provider can help install them.

### 5. Force HTTPS

In WordPress, ensure:
- Site URL uses `https://`
- Force SSL is enabled in WooCommerce settings
