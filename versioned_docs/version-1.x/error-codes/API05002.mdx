# API05002: WCPOS Plugin Not Found

## What This Means

The WCPOS (WooCommerce POS) plugin is not installed or not active on your WordPress site. The POS application requires this plugin to communicate with WooCommerce.

## Common Causes

- **Plugin not installed** — The plugin was never installed
- **Plugin deactivated** — The plugin was disabled
- **Plugin deleted** — The plugin files were removed
- **Wrong site** — Connected to a site without WCPOS

## How to Fix

### 1. Install the Plugin

If not installed:
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New
2. Search for "WooCommerce POS"
3. Install and activate the plugin

Or download from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pos/)

### 2. Activate the Plugin

If installed but not active:
1. Go to Plugins → Installed Plugins
2. Find "WooCommerce POS"
3. Click "Activate"

### 3. Check for Errors

If the plugin won't activate:
- Check for PHP errors in your error log
- Verify WooCommerce is installed and active
- Check PHP version requirements
- Look for plugin conflicts

### 4. Verify the URL

Ensure the POS is configured to connect to the correct WordPress site:
- Check the URL in POS settings
- Verify it matches your WordPress installation

### 5. Reinstall if Necessary

If the plugin is corrupted:
1. Deactivate and delete the plugin
2. Reinstall from WordPress.org
3. Activate the plugin
