Look at the card:
- Find the expiration date (MM/YY format)
- Compare with current date

### 2. Use a Different Card

If the card is truly expired:
- Use a different, valid card
- Use cash or alternative payment
- Ask if customer has a replacement card

### 3. Get the Updated Card

The cardholder should:
- Check mail for a replacement card
- Activate the new card if received
- Contact their bank if no replacement arrived

### 4. Verify Entry

Double-check the expiration entry:
