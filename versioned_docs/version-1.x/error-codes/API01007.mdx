# API01007: Device Offline

## What This Means

Your device is not connected to the internet. The POS detected that there's no active network connection.

## Common Causes

- **WiFi disconnected** — Your device lost its WiFi connection
- **Ethernet unplugged** — The network cable is disconnected
- **Airplane mode enabled** — All wireless connections are disabled
- **Network adapter disabled** — The network interface is turned off

## How to Fix

### 1. Check WiFi Connection

- Verify WiFi is enabled on your device
- Ensure you're connected to the correct network
- Check the WiFi signal strength

### 2. Check Physical Connections

If using ethernet:
- Verify the cable is securely plugged in
- Try a different cable or port
- Check the network switch/router lights

### 3. Disable Airplane Mode

Check if airplane mode is accidentally enabled and disable it.

### 4. Restart Network Adapter

**Windows:**
- Open Network Connections
- Right-click your adapter → Disable, then Enable

**macOS:**
- Turn WiFi off and on from the menu bar
- Or: System Preferences → Network → Turn off/on

### 5. Restart Your Device

Sometimes a simple restart resolves network detection issues.

## Offline Mode

While offline, WCPOS can still:
- Browse and search locally cached products
- Browse and search locally cached customers
- Start new orders and add items to the cart
- View previously synced data

**Requires connectivity:**
- Completing/checking out orders
- Creating new customers

When connectivity is restored, the POS will automatically resume normal operations.
