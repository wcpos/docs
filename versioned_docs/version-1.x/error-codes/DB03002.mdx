# DB03002: Invalid Data Type

## What This Means

The data type doesn't match what the database expects. For example, text was provided where a number was expected.

## Common Causes

- **User input error** — Entering text in a numeric field
- **Import issues** — Imported data has wrong format
- **Data corruption** — Values corrupted during transfer
- **Plugin conflict** — Another plugin modified data types

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Your Input

Review the data you're entering:
- **Prices** — Should be numbers (e.g., `19.99`)
- **Quantities** — Should be whole numbers (e.g., `5`)
- **IDs** — Should be numeric

### 2. Clear and Re-enter

If data was corrupted:
- Clear the field
- Enter the value again manually
- Avoid copy-pasting from external sources

### 3. Check Source Data

If syncing from WooCommerce:
- Check the data in WordPress Admin
- Look for incorrectly formatted fields
- Fix data at the source

### 4. Re-sync Data

Get fresh data from the server:
- Clear local cache
- Sync data again
- Check if the issue resolves

### 5. Check for Plugin Conflicts

If using other WooCommerce plugins:
- They may modify data in unexpected ways
- Temporarily disable to test
- Report incompatibilities

## Common Examples

| Field | Expected | Invalid |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Price | `19.99` | `$19.99` |
| Quantity | `5` | `five` |
| SKU | `ABC123` | — (any format OK) |
| Product ID | `42` | `product-42` |
