# API04004: Missing Response Data

## What This Means

The server responded successfully, but the response is missing expected data. The JSON is valid but doesn't contain the information the POS needs.

## Common Causes

- **Empty results** — No data matches the query
- **Permission restrictions** — Data filtered due to permissions
- **Plugin filtering** — Another plugin filtering API responses
- **Version mismatch** — API version differences
- **Database issues** — Data not present in WooCommerce

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify Data Exists

Check in WordPress Admin:
- Are there products in WooCommerce?
- Are there customers to load?
- Does the specific item exist?

### 2. Check User Permissions

Your user may not have access to all data:
- Verify user role capabilities
- Check POS access settings
- Try with an administrator account

### 3. Check API Response Filters

Some plugins filter REST API responses:
- Disable filtering plugins temporarily
- Check for custom API filters in your theme
- Review security plugin settings

### 4. Update Both Components

Version mismatches can cause issues:
- Update WCPOS plugin
- Update the POS application
- Check for compatibility notes

### 5. Check WooCommerce Data

In WooCommerce:
- Verify products are published (not draft)
- Check if items are marked as visible
- Ensure data isn't corrupted

## Empty vs. Missing

- **Empty response** — Valid response with no results (may be expected)
- **Missing fields** — Response lacks required data fields (this error)
