# API02001: Invalid Credentials

## What This Means

The username or password you entered is incorrect. The server rejected the login attempt because the credentials don't match any valid account.

## Common Causes

- **Typo in username or password** — Check for caps lock or extra spaces
- **Wrong account** — Using credentials for a different site
- **Password recently changed** — The password was updated but the POS has the old one
- **Account deleted** — The user account no longer exists

## Server Error Mapping

This error code is triggered when the server returns:

| Server Code | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `woocommerce_rest_authentication_error` | WooCommerce REST API |
| `jwt_auth_failed` | JWT Authentication plugin |

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify Your Credentials

- Double-check your username (usually email or WordPress username)
- Verify the password is correct
- Try logging into WordPress admin directly to confirm

### 2. Reset Your Password

If you've forgotten your password:
1. Go to your WordPress login page
2. Click "Lost your password?"
3. Enter your email to receive a reset link
4. Update your password
5. Log into the POS with the new password

### 3. Check the User Account

In WordPress Admin:
- Go to Users → All Users
- Verify the account exists
- Check that it has appropriate POS access permissions

### 4. Clear Saved Credentials

In the POS:
- Log out completely
- Clear any saved/cached login information
- Re-enter credentials fresh
