# API01003: Connection Reset

## What This Means

The connection to the server was established but then unexpectedly closed. This typically happens mid-communication when something interrupts the connection.

## Common Causes

- **Server crash** — The server process may have crashed during the request
- **Memory limits** — PHP ran out of memory and was killed
- **Timeout mid-request** — The server timed out while processing
- **Network instability** — Intermittent network issues
- **Security software** — Aggressive security settings closing connections

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Server Error Logs

Look in your WordPress error logs or hosting control panel for related errors around the time of the reset.

### 2. Increase PHP Memory Limit

In your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
```

### 3. Check for Plugin Conflicts

A plugin may be causing PHP to crash:
- Temporarily disable plugins
- Re-enable one by one to find the culprit

### 4. Review Server Resources

Contact your hosting provider to check:
- PHP process limits
- Memory usage at the time of error
- Server stability logs

### 5. Test Network Stability

If on WiFi, try a wired connection. If the issue persists across different networks, it's likely server-side.
