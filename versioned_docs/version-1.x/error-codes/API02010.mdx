# API02010: Auth Required

## What This Means

The action you're trying to perform requires authentication, but you're not currently logged in. The POS needs valid credentials to access this resource.

## Common Causes

- **Not logged in** — You haven't authenticated yet
- **Session cleared** — Your session was cleared or expired
- **Accessing protected resource** — The resource requires authentication
- **App data cleared** — Stored credentials were removed

## Server Error Mapping

This error code is triggered when the server returns:

| Server Code | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `rest_login_required` | WordPress REST API |
| `jwt_auth_no_auth_header` | JWT Authentication plugin |
| HTTP 401 | Any server response (fallback) |

## How to Fix

### 1. Log In

If you haven't logged in:
1. Open the POS login screen
2. Enter your WordPress credentials
3. Complete the authentication process

### 2. Check Session Status

If you thought you were logged in:
- Your session may have expired
- Look for [API02002](./API02002) (Token Expired) for more details
- Log in again to restore access

### 3. Verify Server Configuration

Ensure the API endpoints are properly configured:
- WooCommerce REST API should be enabled
- WCPOS plugin should be active
- Authentication endpoints should be accessible

### 4. Check for Browser/App Issues

If you're being logged out unexpectedly:
- Clear browser cache (if using web version)
- Check that cookies/local storage aren't being blocked
- Verify the app has permission to store data

## What Requires Authentication?

Most POS operations require authentication:
- Viewing products and customers
- Creating and editing orders
- Processing payments
- Accessing reports

Only the initial login screen is accessible without authentication.
