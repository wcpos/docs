# DB01002: Query Timeout

## What This Means

A database operation took too long to complete. The local database query exceeded the maximum allowed time.

## Common Causes

- **Large data set** — Very large number of products or records
- **Complex query** — Query involving many conditions
- **Device performance** — Device is running slowly
- **Database fragmentation** — Database needs optimization

## How to Fix

### 1. Wait and Retry

The query may succeed on retry:
- Close and reopen the POS
- Try the operation again
- Avoid other intensive operations simultaneously

### 2. Close Other Applications

Free up device resources:
- Close unused browser tabs
- Close other applications
- Restart the device if needed

### 3. Reduce Data Scope

If searching:
- Use more specific search terms
- Apply filters to narrow results
- Break large operations into smaller ones

### 4. Optimize the Database

Clear and re-sync:
1. Clear local data (settings option if available)
2. Login again
3. Let data sync fresh

### 5. Check Device Performance

Ensure your device meets requirements:
- Sufficient RAM
- Adequate processor speed
- SSD preferred over HDD

## Large Catalogs

If you have a very large product catalog:
- Initial sync takes longer
- Consider using filters in the POS
- Some operations naturally take more time
- Contact support for optimization advice
