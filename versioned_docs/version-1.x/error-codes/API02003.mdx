# API02003: Token Invalid

## What This Means

The authentication token being used is not recognized by the server. This is different from an expired token — this token was never valid or has been revoked.

## Common Causes

- **Token revoked** — An administrator revoked the session
- **Token corrupted** — Data corruption during storage or transmission
- **Server reset** — Server secret keys changed, invalidating all tokens
- **Wrong server** — Token from a different WordPress installation

## How to Fix

### 1. Log In Again

Clear your session and authenticate fresh:
1. Log out completely
2. Close and reopen the POS
3. Log in with your credentials

### 2. Clear Application Data

If logging out doesn't work:
- Clear the POS app cache/data
- On web: Clear browser cookies and local storage for the site
- On desktop: Check app settings for a "Clear Data" option

### 3. Check Server Configuration

If the issue affects all users:
- Check if WordPress salts were changed
- Verify JWT or authentication plugin settings
- Review recent server changes

### 4. Verify You're on the Correct Server

Ensure the POS is configured to connect to the right WordPress site, especially if you have multiple installations.
