# API02005: Insufficient Permissions

## What This Means

Your user account lacks the specific WordPress capabilities required for this action. While you have basic access, the particular operation you're attempting needs additional permissions.

## Common Causes

- **Limited user role** — Your role doesn't include all needed capabilities
- **Capability not assigned** — A specific capability is missing from your role
- **Plugin restrictions** — A security plugin is limiting capabilities
- **Custom role issues** — Custom roles may be missing capabilities

## How to Fix

### 1. Review Required Capabilities

Common capabilities needed for POS operations:
- `manage_woocommerce` — General WooCommerce management
- `edit_shop_orders` — Create and edit orders
- `edit_products` — Modify product information
- `edit_users` — Manage customer accounts

### 2. Upgrade User Role

Ask an administrator to assign a more capable role:
- **Shop Manager** — Full WooCommerce access
- **Administrator** — Full site access

### 3. Add Specific Capabilities

If you need a custom role, add required capabilities:

```php
// Example: Add POS capabilities to a custom role
$role = get_role('your_custom_role');
$role->add_cap('manage_woocommerce');
$role->add_cap('edit_shop_orders');
```

### 4. Check Plugin Conflicts

Some security or role management plugins may restrict capabilities:
- Review plugin settings
- Check for capability filters
- Temporarily disable to test
