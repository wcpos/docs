# API01001: Connection Timeout

## What This Means

The POS application attempted to connect to your WooCommerce server, but the server took too long to respond. This usually indicates network latency issues or an overloaded server.

## Common Causes

- **Slow internet connection** — Your network connection may be experiencing high latency
- **Server overload** — Your WordPress server may be processing too many requests
- **Large data requests** — Requesting too much data at once can cause timeouts
- **Firewall or proxy delays** — Network security devices may be adding latency

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Your Internet Connection

Test your internet speed and stability. Try loading your WooCommerce admin panel in a browser to see if it responds slowly.

### 2. Reduce Server Load

If your server is overloaded:
- Consider upgrading your hosting plan
- Disable unnecessary plugins temporarily
- Check for heavy cron jobs or background processes

### 3. Optimise Server Response Time

Contact your hosting provider about:
- Enabling PHP opcache
- Increasing PHP memory limits
- Using server-side caching

### 4. Increase Timeout Settings

If your server legitimately needs more time:
- Check if your hosting provider allows increasing PHP execution time
- Consider using a CDN to reduce latency
