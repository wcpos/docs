# API03004: Request Too Large

## What This Means

The request you're sending exceeds the server's size limits. This typically happens when trying to send too much data at once.

## Common Causes

- **Large batch operations** — Trying to sync too many records at once
- **Large images** — Uploading oversized images
- **Too many items** — Order with extremely many line items
- **Server limits** — PHP or web server has low upload limits

## How to Fix

### 1. Reduce Request Size

If syncing data:
- Try syncing in smaller batches
- The POS should handle this automatically
- Wait for current sync to complete before starting another

### 2. Check Image Sizes

If uploading images:
- Resize images before uploading
- Use compressed formats (JPEG vs BMP)
- Most product images work well under 1MB

### 3. Split Large Orders

If an order has many items:
- Consider splitting into multiple orders
- This is rare in normal POS usage

### 4. Increase Server Limits

Contact your hosting provider or edit PHP settings:

```php
// In php.ini or .htaccess
upload_max_filesize = 64M
post_max_size = 64M
max_input_vars = 5000
```

### 5. Check Web Server Limits

Nginx or Apache may have their own limits:
- `client_max_body_size` for Nginx
- `LimitRequestBody` for Apache
