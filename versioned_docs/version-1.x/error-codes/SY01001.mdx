# SY01001: Out of Memory

## What This Means

Your device is running low on memory (RAM) and cannot complete the requested operation. The POS needs sufficient memory to function properly.

## Common Causes

- **Too many apps open** — Other applications using memory
- **Large data set** — Many products/customers loaded
- **Memory leak** — Application not releasing memory properly
- **Insufficient RAM** — Device doesn't have enough memory

## How to Fix

### 1. Close Other Applications

Free up memory:
- Close unused browser tabs
- Close other applications
- Close background programs

### 2. Restart the POS

Refresh the application memory:
1. Close the POS completely
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Reopen the application

### 3. Restart Your Device

A full restart clears all memory:
1. Save any open work
2. Restart your computer/device
3. Open only the POS when starting again

### 4. Clear Browser Data (Web Version)

If using in a browser:
- Clear browser cache
- Close and reopen the browser
- Use fewer browser tabs

### 5. Reduce Data Load

If you have a very large catalog:
- Use filters to load less data at once
- Consider paginating results
- Limit the sync scope if possible

## Minimum Requirements

Ensure your device meets minimum specs:
- **RAM:** 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Browser:** Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **Desktop App:** Check release notes for requirements

## Ongoing Issues

If you frequently run out of memory:
- Consider upgrading your device's RAM
- Use a device with more resources
- Report the issue if it seems excessive
