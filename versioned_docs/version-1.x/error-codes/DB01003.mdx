# DB01003: Transaction Failed

## What This Means

A database transaction could not be completed. Transactions group multiple operations together — if any part fails, everything is rolled back to maintain data integrity.

## Common Causes

- **Concurrent access** — Multiple operations trying to modify the same data
- **Storage full** — No space to write new data
- **Database locked** — Another process is locking the database
- **Power interruption** — Operation interrupted unexpectedly

## How to Fix

### 1. Retry the Operation

The issue may be temporary:
- Wait a moment
- Try the operation again
- Avoid rapid repeated attempts

### 2. Check for Conflicts

If multiple devices or tabs are open:
- Use one instance at a time
- Close duplicate browser tabs
- Coordinate multi-device usage

### 3. Check Storage Space

Ensure there's space for data:
- Check available disk space
- Free up space if needed
- Clear browser cache (web version)

### 4. Restart the Application

Reset the database state:
1. Close the POS completely
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Reopen the application

### 5. Clear and Re-sync

If transactions consistently fail:
1. Clear local data
2. Login again
3. Sync fresh from server

## Transaction Safety

WCPOS uses transactions to ensure:
- Data consistency
- Complete operations (all or nothing)
- Protection against partial updates

When a transaction fails, your data remains consistent.
