# API01002: Connection Refused

## What This Means

The server actively refused the connection attempt. This is different from a timeout — the server responded, but said "no."

## Common Causes

- **Server is down** — The web server (Apache/Nginx) may not be running
- **Wrong port** — Attempting to connect on the wrong port
- **Firewall blocking** — A firewall is blocking the connection
- **IP restrictions** — Your IP address may be blocked

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify the Server is Running

Try accessing your WordPress site directly in a browser. If it's not loading, contact your hosting provider.

### 2. Check the URL Configuration

Ensure you're using the correct URL:
- Verify `http://` vs `https://`
- Check for typos in the domain name
- Confirm the correct port if using a non-standard one

### 3. Check Firewall Settings

If you have access to your server:
- Verify that port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) is open
- Check if your IP is whitelisted
- Review any security plugins that may block API access

### 4. Contact Your Hosting Provider

They can check:
- Server status and logs
- Firewall configurations
- Whether your IP has been blocked
