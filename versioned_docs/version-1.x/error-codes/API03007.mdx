# API03007: Request Queue Full

## What This Means

The POS has too many pending requests waiting to be sent. The internal queue is full and cannot accept more requests until some complete.

## Common Causes

- **Slow network** — Requests backing up due to slow connection
- **Server unresponsive** — Server taking too long to respond
- **Rapid actions** — Performing many actions faster than they can process
- **Sync overload** — Large sync operation blocking the queue

## How to Fix

### 1. Wait for Queue to Clear

Give pending requests time to complete:
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Watch for sync indicators to complete
- Avoid additional actions until cleared

### 2. Check Network Connection

A slow connection causes backup:
- Test your internet speed
- Try a faster connection
- Move closer to WiFi router

### 3. Check Server Response Time

If the server is slow:
- Test accessing your site in a browser
- Contact hosting if site is slow
- Wait for server load to decrease

### 4. Restart the POS

If the queue is stuck:
1. Close the POS application
2. Wait a moment
3. Reopen the POS
4. Pending requests may need to be re-initiated

### 5. Avoid Rapid Actions

During sync or slow periods:
- Wait for one action to complete before starting another
- Don't repeatedly click buttons
- Be patient with network operations

## Offline Behaviour

When the queue fills due to offline conditions:
- The POS will hold pending requests until back online
- You can still browse cached products and customers
- You can start new orders and add items to the cart
- Completing orders requires connectivity to be restored
