# API02002: Token Expired

## What This Means

Your authentication session has expired. For security reasons, login sessions don't last forever. The POS needs to refresh your authentication or you may need to log in again.

## Common Causes

- **Long inactivity** — You haven't used the POS for an extended period
- **Server token lifetime** — The server's token expiration is set very short
- **Server time mismatch** — Server and device clocks are out of sync

## How to Fix

### 1. Log In Again

The simplest solution is to log out and log back in:
1. Log out of the POS
2. Enter your credentials again
3. This creates a fresh session

### 2. Check Token Refresh

The POS should automatically refresh tokens. If it's not working:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the server is accessible
- See [API02007](./API02007) if refresh is failing

### 3. Check Server Time

Token expiration depends on accurate time:
- Ensure your server's clock is correct
- Check that your device's time is accurate
- Use automatic time sync on both

### 4. Review Token Settings

If tokens expire too quickly, you may need to adjust server settings (consult your hosting provider or WordPress administrator).
