# API06001: Invalid URL Format

## What This Means

The URL configured for your WooCommerce site is not in a valid format. URLs must follow standard web address conventions.

## Common Causes

- **Missing protocol** — URL doesn't start with `http://` or `https://`
- **Typo in URL** — Spelling errors in the domain
- **Invalid characters** — Special characters that aren't allowed in URLs
- **Incomplete URL** — URL is missing parts like the domain extension

## How to Fix

### 1. Check URL Format

A valid URL should look like:
- ✅ `https://yourstore.com`
- ✅ `https://www.yourstore.com`
- ✅ `https://store.yourdomain.com`
- ❌ `yourstore.com` (missing protocol)
- ❌ `https://yourstore` (missing extension)
- ❌ `https://your store.com` (contains space)

### 2. Include the Protocol

Always include `https://` or `http://`:
- Preferred: `https://` (secure)
- Fallback: `http://` (if HTTPS isn't available)

### 3. Remove Extra Characters

Ensure the URL doesn't have:
- Trailing slashes (optional but be consistent)
- Extra spaces
- Special characters
- URL parameters (unless required)

### 4. Verify the URL Works

Test the URL in a browser:
1. Copy the URL you're using
2. Paste it in a browser
3. It should load your WordPress site

### 5. Update POS Configuration

Enter the corrected URL in the POS settings:
- Match exactly what works in your browser
- Include or exclude `www.` as your site uses

## Examples

| Invalid | Valid |
|---------|-------|
| `mystore.com` | `https://mystore.com` |
| `https://my store.com` | `https://mystore.com` |
| `https://mystore` | `https://mystore.com` |
| `htp://mystore.com` | `https://mystore.com` |
