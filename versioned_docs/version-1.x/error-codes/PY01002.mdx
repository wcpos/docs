# PY01002: Insufficient Funds

## What This Means

The payment was declined because there isn't enough money in the account to cover the transaction.

## Common Causes

- **Low account balance** — Not enough funds available
- **Pending transactions** — Other pending transactions reducing available balance
- **Credit limit reached** — For credit cards, the limit is maxed out
- **Hold on funds** — Funds are on hold for other transactions

## How to Fix

### 1. Use a Different Payment Method

The quickest solution:
- Try a different card
- Use cash
- Split payment across multiple methods (if supported)

### 2. Reduce the Order Amount

If partial payment is possible:
- Remove some items
- Apply discounts or coupons
- Complete a smaller transaction

### 3. Customer Actions

The customer may need to:
- Transfer funds to the account
- Wait for pending transactions to clear
- Pay off credit card balance
- Request a credit limit increase

### 4. Split the Transaction

If your POS supports split payments:
- Pay part with one card
- Pay the remainder with another method

## Privacy Note

When communicating this to customers:
- Be discreet about the specific decline reason
- Simply state "the card was declined"
- Allow them to try another payment method privately
