# DB03001: Query Syntax Error

## What This Means

The database query has syntax errors. This typically indicates a bug in the application rather than a user error.

## Common Causes

- **Software bug** — An issue in the POS application
- **Version mismatch** — Incompatible data schema
- **Corrupted data** — Data contains unexpected characters
- **Encoding issues** — Character encoding problems

## How to Fix

### 1. Update the Application

Ensure you're running the latest version:
- Check for POS app updates
- Update the WCPOS WordPress plugin
- Restart after updating

### 2. Clear Application Data

Reset to a clean state:
- Clear local data/cache
- Login again
- Re-sync data

### 3. Check for Special Characters

If the error occurs with specific data:
- Check for unusual characters in product names
- Look for emojis or special symbols
- Try with simpler data

### 4. Report the Bug

If the issue persists:
1. Note what action causes the error
2. Capture any error details
3. Report on [GitHub](https://github.com/wcpos)

## This is Usually a Bug
