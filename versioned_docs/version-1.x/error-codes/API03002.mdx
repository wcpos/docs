# API03002: Missing Required Parameters

## What This Means

The request is missing data that the server needs to complete the action. Required fields were not included in the request.

## Common Causes

- **Incomplete form** — Required fields weren't filled in
- **Data not saved** — Form data wasn't captured properly
- **Version mismatch** — Plugin expects different parameters than the POS sends
- **Custom fields** — Required custom fields are missing

## How to Fix

### 1. Complete Required Fields

Check that all required information is filled in:
- Customer details (if required)
- Product information
- Order details

### 2. Refresh and Retry

The form state may be incomplete:
1. Refresh the POS
2. Re-enter the required information
3. Try the action again

### 3. Check Plugin Versions

Ensure compatibility:
- Update the WCPOS plugin
- Update the POS application
- Both should be on compatible versions

### 4. Check Required Field Settings

In WooCommerce, some fields may be marked as required:
- Review checkout field requirements
- Check custom field configurations
- Adjust requirements if needed

### 5. Check Custom Integrations

If using custom plugins or integrations:
- They may require additional fields
- Review plugin documentation
- Check for conflicts
