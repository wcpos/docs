# API02007: Token Refresh Failed

## What This Means

The POS tried to automatically renew your authentication session, but the refresh request failed. This typically means you'll need to log in again.

## Common Causes

- **Refresh token expired** — The refresh token itself has expired
- **Refresh token revoked** — An admin invalidated all sessions
- **Server error** — The server couldn't process the refresh request
- **Network issue** — Connection problem during refresh attempt

## How to Fix

### 1. Log In Again

The most reliable fix:
1. Log out of the POS
2. Log back in with your credentials
3. This creates a fresh session with new tokens

### 2. Check Network Connection

If refresh is failing due to network issues:
- Verify your internet connection
- Try accessing your WordPress site in a browser
- Wait a moment and try again

### 3. Check Server Status

If the server is having issues:
- Verify WordPress is running properly
- Check for PHP errors in your server logs
- Ensure the authentication plugin is active

### 4. Clear Session Data

If issues persist:
- Clear the POS app cache
- Remove stored credentials
- Start fresh with a new login

## Automatic Token Refresh

WCPOS automatically refreshes tokens before they expire to maintain your session. If this process fails repeatedly, there may be a configuration issue that needs attention.
