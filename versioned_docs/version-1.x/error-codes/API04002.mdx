# API04002: Unexpected Response Code

## What This Means

The server returned an HTTP status code that wasn't expected for this request. Common codes include 500 (server error), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), etc.

## Common Causes

- **500 Internal Server Error** — PHP crashed or encountered an error
- **403 Forbidden** — Access denied by security settings
- **404 Not Found** — The endpoint doesn't exist
- **502/503/504** — Server gateway or availability issues

## How to Fix

### For 500 Errors (Server Error)

1. Check PHP error logs
2. Increase PHP memory limit
3. Look for plugin conflicts
4. Check `wp-content/debug.log`

### For 403 Errors (Forbidden)

1. Check security plugin settings (Wordfence, Sucuri, etc.)
2. Whitelist the POS or your IP
3. Check `.htaccess` for blocking rules
4. Verify ModSecurity isn't blocking requests

### For 404 Errors (Not Found)

1. Verify the WCPOS plugin is active
2. Flush WordPress permalinks (Settings → Permalinks → Save)
3. Check if REST API is enabled
4. Verify URL configuration

### For 502/503/504 Errors (Gateway Issues)

1. Contact your hosting provider
2. Wait for server to recover
3. Check if site is under heavy load
4. Verify server is running

### General Troubleshooting

1. Try accessing your site directly
2. Check hosting control panel for issues
3. Review server access logs
4. Contact hosting support if needed
