# API05005: Plugin Not Found

## What This Means

A required WordPress plugin is not installed or active. This could be WooCommerce itself, a required extension, or an integration plugin.

## Common Causes

- **WooCommerce deactivated** — WooCommerce was disabled
- **Required extension missing** — A needed WooCommerce extension isn't installed
- **Plugin conflict** — Another plugin caused a required plugin to deactivate
- **Failed update** — A plugin update failed and left it deactivated

## How to Fix

### 1. Verify WooCommerce is Active

WCPOS requires WooCommerce:
1. Go to Plugins → Installed Plugins
2. Find "WooCommerce"
3. Ensure it's activated

### 2. Check for Required Extensions

Some WCPOS features may require extensions:
- Check error message for specific plugin name
- Install and activate the required extension

### 3. Review Plugin Conflicts

If plugins were deactivated due to conflicts:
1. Check your email for WordPress notifications
2. Review error logs
3. Resolve conflicts and reactivate

### 4. Check Plugin Files

If a plugin's files are missing:
1. Reinstall the plugin from WordPress.org
2. Or restore from backup
3. Activate the plugin

### 5. Update All Plugins

Outdated plugins may cause issues:
1. Go to Dashboard → Updates
2. Update all plugins
3. Verify all required plugins are active

## Required Plugins

At minimum, WCPOS requires:
- **WooCommerce** — The e-commerce platform
- **WCPOS** — The POS plugin

Additional features may require other plugins.
