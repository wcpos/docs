# API04006: Resource Not Found

## What This Means

The server could not find the requested resource. This typically corresponds to an HTTP 404 status code, indicating the product, order, customer, or other resource you're trying to access doesn't exist.

## Common Causes

- **Record deleted** — The resource was deleted on the server
- **Wrong ID** — An incorrect or outdated ID is being used
- **Sync issues** — Local data references a resource that no longer exists
- **URL misconfiguration** — The API endpoint is incorrect
- **Permalink issues** — WordPress permalinks need to be refreshed

## Server Error Mapping

This error code is triggered when the server returns:

| Server Code | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `rest_no_route` | WordPress REST API |
| HTTP 404 | Any server response |

## How to Fix

### 1. Check if the Resource Exists

Verify the resource still exists on your WooCommerce site:
- Log into WordPress admin
- Navigate to the relevant section (Products, Orders, Customers)
- Search for the item by ID or name

### 2. Refresh Local Data

If the resource was deleted server-side:
1. Open the POS settings
2. Navigate to the relevant data section
3. Trigger a sync/refresh to update local data
4. The deleted item should be removed locally

### 3. Check WordPress Permalinks

If multiple resources are not found:
1. Go to **Settings → Permalinks** in WordPress admin
2. Click **Save Changes** (even without making changes)
3. This refreshes the permalink structure

### 4. Verify API Routes

Test the REST API directly:
```
https://yoursite.com/wp-json/wc/v3/products
```
If this returns a 404, there may be a server configuration issue.

### 5. Check for Plugin Conflicts

If REST API routes are missing:
1. Ensure WooCommerce is active
2. Ensure WCPOS plugin is active
3. Disable other plugins temporarily to test
