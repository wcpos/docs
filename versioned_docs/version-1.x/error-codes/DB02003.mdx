# DB02003: Constraint Violation

## What This Means

The data you're trying to save violates database rules. Constraints ensure data integrity by enforcing rules about what data can be stored.

## Common Causes

- **Missing required data** — A required field is empty
- **Invalid relationship** — Referencing a record that doesn't exist
- **Data type mismatch** — Wrong type of data for the field
- **Value out of range** — Number exceeds allowed limits

## How to Fix

### 1. Check Required Fields

Ensure all required data is provided:
- Customer information (if required)
- Product details
- Order line items

### 2. Verify References

If the error involves relationships:
- Ensure referenced products exist
- Check that customer IDs are valid
- Verify category assignments

### 3. Review Data Values

Check for invalid values:
- Negative quantities where not allowed
- Prices exceeding limits
- Invalid status values

### 4. Sync Latest Data

The referenced data may be out of sync:
- Refresh data from server
- Wait for sync to complete
- Retry the operation

### 5. Clear and Retry

If data is corrupted:
1. Clear the problematic form
2. Re-enter the data
3. Submit again

## Common Constraint Examples

- **Quantity must be positive** — Can't add 0 or negative items
- **Price must be numeric** — Text not allowed in price fields
- **Customer must exist** — Can't assign order to non-existent customer
