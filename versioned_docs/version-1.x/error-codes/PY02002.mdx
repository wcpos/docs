# PY02002: Payment Timeout

## What This Means

The payment processing took too long and timed out. The payment gateway didn't respond within the expected time.

## Common Causes

- **Gateway overload** — Payment processor is experiencing high volume
- **Network latency** — Slow connection to the payment service
- **Processing delay** — Complex fraud checks or verification
- **Server issues** — Payment gateway having performance issues

## How to Fix

### 1. Check if Payment Succeeded

**Important:** Before retrying, verify the payment status:
- Check your payment gateway dashboard
- Look for the transaction in WooCommerce
- Don't process again if it actually succeeded

### 2. Retry with Caution

If the payment definitely didn't go through:
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Try again
- Watch for duplicate charges

### 3. Check Your Connection

Ensure stable connectivity:
- Test your internet connection
- Try a wired connection if on WiFi
- Check for network issues

### 4. Try at a Less Busy Time

If the gateway is overloaded:
- Retail peak times may cause slowdowns
- Try again shortly
- Use an alternative payment method

### 5. Contact Payment Provider

If timeouts persist:
- Check their status page
- Contact their support
- Report ongoing issues

## Avoiding Duplicate Charges

When a timeout occurs:
1. **Don't immediately retry** — Check the status first
2. **Review transactions** — Check both gateway and WooCommerce
3. **Refund duplicates** — Process refunds for any accidental duplicates
4. **Inform the customer** — Explain the situation if there's a delay

## Alternative Actions

If payment keeps timing out:
- Accept cash payment
- Record as "pay later" if allowed
- Use a different payment method
