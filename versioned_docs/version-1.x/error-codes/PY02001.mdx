# PY02001: Payment Gateway Error

## What This Means

An error occurred while communicating with the payment gateway. The payment processor couldn't complete the request.

## Common Causes

- **Gateway downtime** — The payment service is experiencing issues
- **Configuration error** — Gateway settings are incorrect
- **API credentials** — Invalid or expired API keys
- **Network issues** — Connection problems to the gateway

## How to Fix

### 1. Retry the Transaction

Sometimes gateways have temporary issues:
- Wait a moment
- Try processing the payment again
- The issue may resolve itself

### 2. Check Gateway Status

Visit your payment provider's status page:
- Stripe: status.stripe.com
- PayPal: Check PayPal community or status
- Square: status.squareup.com
- Check for known outages

### 3. Verify Gateway Configuration

In WooCommerce Admin:
1. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Payments
2. Click on your payment gateway
3. Verify API keys are correct
4. Check that test/live mode matches your keys

### 4. Check API Credentials

Ensure credentials are valid:
- API keys haven't expired
- Using live keys for live transactions
- Using test keys for test transactions
- Credentials match the correct account

### 5. Test with a Different Gateway

If available:
- Try processing with an alternative gateway
- Use cash payment as a fallback
- Complete the sale and reconcile later

## For Store Owners

Common configuration issues:
- Mixing test and live API keys
- API keys from different accounts
- Disabled payment methods
- Expired or revoked credentials

Contact your payment provider's support if the issue persists.
