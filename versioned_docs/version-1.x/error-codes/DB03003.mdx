# DB03003: Missing Required Field

## What This Means

A required field was not provided. The database cannot save the record because essential information is missing.

## Common Causes

- **Incomplete form** — Required fields weren't filled in
- **Data sync issue** — Required data didn't sync properly
- **Validation bypassed** — Form submitted without validation
- **Custom field required** — A custom required field is empty

## How to Fix

### 1. Complete All Required Fields

Check the form for:
- Fields marked with asterisks (*)
- Highlighted or error-marked fields
- Empty fields that should have values

### 2. Refresh and Re-enter

If the form state is incorrect:
1. Refresh the page/screen
2. Re-enter all information
3. Verify all fields before submitting

### 3. Check WooCommerce Settings

If custom fields are required:
1. Review WooCommerce checkout settings
2. Check for required custom fields
3. Ensure the POS provides these fields

### 4. Sync Required Data

If related data is missing:
- Refresh products/customers/etc.
- Wait for sync to complete
- Retry the operation

### 5. Review Required Field Settings

In WooCommerce Admin:
- Check which fields are marked required
- Consider if all are truly necessary for POS
- Adjust requirements if needed

## Common Required Fields

Typically required for orders:
- At least one line item
