# API06002: Missing API URL

## What This Means

No URL has been configured for connecting to your WooCommerce store. The POS needs to know where your store is located.

## Common Causes

- **First-time setup** — URL was never entered
- **Configuration cleared** — Settings were reset or cleared
- **App data cleared** — Application data was deleted
- **Migration issue** — URL lost during update or migration

## How to Fix

### 1. Enter Your Store URL

In the POS app:
1. Open settings or login screen
2. Find the URL/Site configuration field
3. Enter your WordPress site URL
4. Example: `https://yourstore.com`

### 2. Find Your WordPress URL

If you're unsure of your URL:
1. Log into WordPress Admin
2. Go to Settings → General
3. Look at "WordPress Address (URL)"
4. Use this URL in the POS

### 3. Check Stored Settings

If the URL was previously configured:
- Check if app data was accidentally cleared
- Look for settings backup/export options
- Re-enter the URL if needed

### 4. Verify URL is Correct

Before saving:
1. Test the URL in a browser
2. Ensure it loads your WordPress site
3. Include `https://` or `http://`
