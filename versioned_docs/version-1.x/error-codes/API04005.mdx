# API04005: JSON Recovery Attempted

## What This Means

The server sent a response with some invalid JSON content, but the POS attempted to recover and extract valid data. This is an informational notice rather than a critical error.

## What Happened

The POS detected:
1. The response contained extra content before or after the JSON
2. The core JSON data was still identifiable
3. Recovery was attempted by extracting the valid JSON portion

## Common Causes

- **PHP notices in output** — PHP warnings mixed with JSON
- **Debug output** — Development debugging left enabled
- **Plugin notices** — Other plugins outputting notices
- **Whitespace issues** — Extra whitespace around JSON

## How to Fix

### 1. Disable PHP Display Errors

In `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
ini_set('display_errors', 0);
```

### 2. Enable Error Logging Instead

Keep errors logged for debugging:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

### 3. Check for Plugin Debug Mode

Some plugins have debug modes that output extra content:
- Review plugin settings
- Disable debug/development modes
- Check for verbose logging options

### 4. Review Recent Changes

If this started recently:
- What changed on your server?
- Were plugins updated?
- Were PHP settings modified?

## Is This Serious?

While the POS recovered from this issue, it indicates a configuration problem that should be fixed. The recovery process:
- May not always work
- Adds processing overhead
- Could mask other issues

Fix the underlying cause to ensure reliable operation.
