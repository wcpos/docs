# SY02001: Invalid Configuration

## What This Means

The system configuration is invalid or corrupted. The POS application found configuration settings that don't make sense or are incomplete.

## Common Causes

- **Corrupted settings** — Configuration file became corrupted
- **Incomplete setup** — Setup process wasn't completed
- **Manual editing error** — Config files were incorrectly modified
- **Version upgrade issue** — Old config incompatible with new version

## How to Fix

### 1. Reset to Default Settings

If available in the app:
- Look for "Reset Settings" or "Restore Defaults"
- This clears custom settings but fixes corruption

### 2. Complete the Setup

If setup wasn't finished:
1. Start the setup process again
2. Complete all required steps
3. Verify configuration before finishing

### 3. Clear Application Data

Remove corrupted config:
- **Desktop:** Delete app data folder, restart app
- **Browser:** Clear site data, reload

### 4. Reinstall the Application

For persistent issues:
1. Uninstall completely
2. Remove any leftover data folders
3. Reinstall fresh
4. Complete setup from scratch

### 5. Check for Updates

Configuration formats may change:
- Update the POS application
- Update the WCPOS plugin
- Reconfigure after update

## What Gets Reset

When resetting configuration:
- You'll need to log in again
- Custom settings will be lost
- Data will need to re-sync
- But your WooCommerce data is safe on the server
