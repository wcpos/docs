# API03006: Unsupported Method

## What This Means

The HTTP method used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) is not supported for this endpoint. The server doesn't accept this type of request for this URL.

## Common Causes

- **Version mismatch** — POS and plugin versions are incompatible
- **Endpoint removed** — An API endpoint was deprecated
- **Server configuration** — Web server blocking certain HTTP methods
- **Plugin conflict** — Another plugin modifying REST API behaviour

## How to Fix

### 1. Update Both Components

Ensure compatibility:
- Update the WCPOS WordPress plugin
- Update the POS application
- Check release notes for breaking changes

### 2. Check Server Configuration

Some servers block certain HTTP methods:
- Ensure PUT and DELETE methods are allowed
- Check `.htaccess` for method restrictions
- Review Nginx configuration

### 3. Verify REST API Access

Test the WordPress REST API:
1. Visit `https://yoursite.com/wp-json/` in a browser
2. It should return JSON data
3. If not, the REST API may be disabled or blocked

### 4. Check for Plugin Conflicts

Disable other plugins temporarily:
- Security plugins may block methods
- Other REST API plugins may cause conflicts
- Re-enable one by one to find the issue

### 5. Review Hosting Restrictions

Some hosts restrict HTTP methods:
- Contact hosting support
- Request they enable all standard methods
- Consider switching hosts if too restrictive
