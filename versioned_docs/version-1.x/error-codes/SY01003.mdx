# SY01003: Permission Denied

## What This Means

The POS application doesn't have permission to access a required resource. This could be a file, folder, or system feature.

## Common Causes

- **File permissions** — Can't read or write to needed files
- **App permissions** — Application lacks required permissions
- **Protected folder** — Trying to access a restricted location
- **Security software** — Antivirus blocking access

## How to Fix

### 1. Run as Administrator (Windows)

Right-click the app and select "Run as administrator" if needed for initial setup.

### 2. Check Application Permissions

**macOS:**
- System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy
- Check that the app has necessary permissions

**Windows:**
- Settings → Privacy
- Review app permissions

### 3. Check Folder Permissions

Ensure the app can access its data folder:
- The user should own the app data directory
- Write permissions should be enabled
- No read-only flags on the folder

### 4. Review Antivirus Settings

Security software may block access:
- Check antivirus logs for blocks
- Add the POS app to the allowlist
- Whitelist the app data folder

### 5. Reinstall the Application

If permissions are corrupted:
1. Uninstall the POS application
2. Restart your device
3. Reinstall to a standard location
4. Run with normal (non-admin) permissions

## Browser Permissions (Web Version)

If using the web version:
- Allow local storage for the site
- Enable cookies for the site
- Don't use overly restrictive browser settings
