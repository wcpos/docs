### What is Meta Data in WooCommerce?

Meta data provides extra information about orders and is accessible via the WooCommerce REST API. Developers and plugins use this data to extend functionality, such as integrating third-party services.

### JSON View

- View the raw JSON representation of the order, useful for debugging or integration purposes.

## Save to Server

- Allows you to save open carts to the server, so they are securely stored and accessible for future use.

### Why save?

When a new order is created in the POS, it only exists locally. 
Saving the order ensures it persists, even if the local database is cleared.

## Void

- Two Scenarios:
  - Unsaved Orders:
    - If the order has not been saved to the server, it will be permanently deleted from the local database.
  - Saved Orders:
    - If the order is saved to the server, it will be moved to the Trash folder in WooCommerce and deleted from the local database.
- To recover a voided order:
  - Go to `WP Admin > WooCommerce > Orders > Trash`.

## Checkout

- Saves the order to the server and initiates the checkout process.
- Opens the checkout screen to complete the payment.
