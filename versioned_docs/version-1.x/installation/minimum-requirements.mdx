### Server Requirements:

Meeting these minimum requirements ensures compatibility and stability between the WCPOS plugin and your WordPress environment. It also ensures that you can benefit from the latest features and enhancements provided by the plugin.

### Browser Requirements:

- **Modern web browser:** The WCPOS plugin is designed to work with modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Please make sure you are using the latest stable version of your preferred browser.
- **JavaScript enabled:** The WCPOS plugin relies on JavaScript for its interactive features. Please ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
- **No private browsing mode:** The browser should not be in private browsing mode as it may restrict access to the browser's IndexedDB (IDB) database. Private browsing mode can prevent the proper functioning of certain features in the WCPOS plugin.
