The "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')" error occurs when the Point of Sale (POS) system expects to receive data from the server but instead receives an empty response. This issue can be resolved by following the troubleshooting steps outlined below.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check the Network Tab in the Browser

1. Open the POS application in your browser.
2. Open the developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS).
3. Navigate to the "Network" tab in the developer tools.
4. Look for the failed request, usually marked in red or with a relevant HTTP status code (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
5. Select the failed request to view its details.
6. Examine the response section of the request for any error messages or issues with the JSON data.
7. Copy any relevant error messages or take a screenshot and share them with our support team by posting them to the [Discord chat](https://wcpos.com/discord) or emailing them to support@wcpos.com.
