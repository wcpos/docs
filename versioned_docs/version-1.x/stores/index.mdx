:::info Pro Feature
Multi-store functionality requires [WCPOS Pro](/getting-started/pro-license).
:::

WCPOS Pro lets you create separate store locations within a single WooCommerce installation. Each store can have its own address, logo, and settings — useful if you operate from multiple physical locations.

## What Stores Provide

Each store can have:

- **Store name and address** — used on receipts and reports
- **Store logo** — displayed on printed receipts
- **Tax rates** — different locations may have different tax requirements
- **Cashier assignment** — track which cashiers work at which store

## Setting Up Stores

1. Go to `WP Admin > POS > Settings`
2. Create a new store with its name, address, and logo
3. Configure any store-specific tax settings
4. Assign the store to POS users

When a cashier logs into the POS, they select which store they're operating from. This determines the store details that appear on receipts and which store filter is applied to reports.

## Filtering by Store

Once you have multiple stores configured, the store filter appears across the POS:

- **[Orders](/orders)** — filter order history by store location
- **[Reports](/reports)** — generate end-of-day reports for a specific store
- **[Receipts](/pos/checkout/receipts)** — receipts automatically display the correct store address and logo

## Inventory Management

:::note Shared Inventory
WCPOS currently uses a **single shared inventory** across all store locations. All stores draw from the same WooCommerce stock levels. Per-location inventory tracking is not yet supported.
:::

If you need separate stock levels per location, there are two approaches:

### WordPress Multisite

The most reliable way to get fully separate inventories is to use [WordPress Multisite](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/):

1. Create a separate WordPress site for each store location
2. Install WooCommerce and WCPOS on each site
3. Each site maintains its own independent product catalogue and stock levels

This gives you complete separation but means managing multiple WooCommerce installations.

### Third-Party Plugins

Some WooCommerce plugins add per-location inventory tracking (e.g., warehouse management plugins). If such a plugin exposes stock data through the WooCommerce REST API, WCPOS will reflect those stock levels. However, compatibility varies — test thoroughly on a staging site before relying on any third-party inventory plugin.

## Store-Specific Pricing

WCPOS does not currently support different prices for different store locations. All stores share the same product prices from WooCommerce.

For ad-hoc price adjustments at specific locations, cashiers can use [POS discounts](/pos/cart/discounts) to change individual item prices during checkout.

## Known Limitations

- **Shared inventory** — all stores draw from the same WooCommerce stock levels
- **Shared pricing** — no per-store pricing support
- **Single WooCommerce instance** — stores are locations within one WooCommerce installation, not separate shops
- **No per-store product visibility** — all stores see the same product catalogue
