Server performance directly impacts the speed and responsiveness of your WCPOS application. This guide helps you monitor, diagnose, and optimize server performance using the built-in metrics and troubleshooting techniques.

## Understanding Server Metrics

WCPOS automatically collects server performance metrics with each data fetch operation (products, orders, customers, etc.). You can view these metrics in the [Logs](/support/logs) screen.

### Typical Server Metrics

```json
{
  "total": "24692",
  "execution_time": "76.64 ms",
  "server_load": "[15.20605469,16.16357422,16.76806641]"
}
```

**Breakdown:**
- **`total`** - Number of records processed (24,692 product IDs)
- **`execution_time`** - Time taken to complete the operation (76.64 milliseconds)
- **`server_load`** - Server load averages for 1, 5, and 15 minutes

## Server Load Explained

Server load represents the average system load over different time periods:

- **First value** - 1-minute average (15.21)
- **Second value** - 5-minute average (16.16)
- **Third value** - 15-minute average (16.77)

### Load Interpretation

Server load values can be misleading and should be interpreted carefully:

:::warning Load Values Can Be Misleading
Server load averages don't always correlate directly with performance. A server with high load values (15+) can still be very responsive if it has sufficient resources and is well-optimized. **Focus on execution times rather than load values alone.**
:::

**General Guidelines:**
- **Load relative to CPU cores** - A load of 8.0 on an 8-core server means full utilization
- **Sustained vs. temporary** - Brief spikes are normal, sustained high load may indicate issues
- **Performance matters more** - A responsive server with high load is better than a slow server with low load

**What to watch for:**
- **Execution times increasing** over time
- **Load consistently growing** without explanation
- **Both high load AND slow execution times** together

## Performance Benchmarks

### Execution Time Guidelines

| Operation | Good | Acceptable | Poor | Critical |
|-----------|------|------------|------|----------|
| **Product fetch** | < 100ms | 100-500ms | 500ms-2s | > 2s |
| **Order creation** | < 200ms | 200-800ms | 800ms-3s | > 3s |
| **Customer sync** | < 50ms | 50-200ms | 200ms-1s | > 1s |
| **Tax calculation** | < 30ms | 30-100ms | 100-500ms | > 500ms |

### Record Count Considerations

Execution time should scale reasonably with record count:

```json
// Good scaling examples
{"total": "100", "execution_time": "15.2 ms"}    // 0.15ms per record
{"total": "1000", "execution_time": "89.4 ms"}   // 0.09ms per record
{"total": "10000", "execution_time": "234.1 ms"} // 0.02ms per record

// Poor scaling examples
{"total": "100", "execution_time": "500.0 ms"}   // 5.0ms per record
{"total": "1000", "execution_time": "8000.0 ms"} // 8.0ms per record
```

## Diagnosing Performance Issues

### Step 1: Monitor the Logs

1. Open **Logs** from the navigation drawer
2. Perform the slow operation (sync products, create order, etc.)
3. Look for the corresponding log entry
4. Expand the context to see metrics

### Step 2: Analyze the Metrics

**High execution time + High server load = Server resource issue**
```json
{
  "total": "5000",
  "execution_time": "3500.0 ms",
  "server_load": "[12.45, 11.23, 10.87]"
}
```
*Solution: Increase server resources or optimize server configuration*

**High execution time + Normal server load = Plugin/database issue**
```json
{
  "total": "1000",
  "execution_time": "2800.0 ms",
  "server_load": "[1.23, 1.45, 1.67]"
}
```
*Solution: Identify slow plugins or optimize database queries*

**Normal execution time + High server load = General server overload**
```json
{
  "total": "2000",
  "execution_time": "150.0 ms",
  "server_load": "[8.90, 9.12, 8.45]"
}
```
*Solution: Reduce server load from other processes or upgrade resources*

## Common Performance Problems

### 1. Insufficient Server Resources

**Symptoms:**
- Consistently high server load (> 4.0 on most servers)
- Long execution times across all operations
- Frequent timeouts

**Solutions:**
- **Upgrade CPU** - More cores handle concurrent requests better
- **Increase RAM** - Reduces disk I/O and improves caching
- **Use SSD storage** - Dramatically improves database performance
- **Optimize PHP settings** - Increase memory_limit, max_execution_time

### 2. Slow Database Queries

**Symptoms:**
- High execution times with normal server load
- Particularly slow product/order fetching
- Database-related error codes in logs

**Solutions:**
- **Enable WooCommerce HPOS** - The single biggest database performance improvement
- **Use object caching** - Redis or Memcached if available from your host
- **Keep WordPress updated** - Core updates often include database optimizations
- **Limit post revisions** - Add `define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3);` to wp-config.php

### 3. Plugin Interference

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden performance degradation after plugin updates
- Specific operations much slower than others
- High execution times with normal server load

**Troubleshooting:**
1. **Test on staging** - Disable all plugins except WooCommerce and WCPOS
2. **Measure baseline** - Record execution times with minimal plugins
3. **Enable gradually** - Add plugins one by one to identify culprits
4. **Check plugin hooks** - Look for plugins hooking into WooCommerce actions

**Common problematic plugins:**
- Heavy SEO plugins during product operations
- Complex inventory management systems
- Real-time analytics/tracking plugins
- Poorly coded custom plugins

### 4. WordPress/WooCommerce Configuration

**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent performance
- Memory-related errors in logs
- Slow admin dashboard

**Optimization checklist:**
- **PHP version** - Use PHP 8.0+ for better performance
- **WooCommerce HPOS** - Enable High-Performance Order Storage (see below)
- **WordPress caching** - Enable object caching if available
- **WooCommerce settings** - Optimize product image sizes

### WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS)

:::tip Biggest Performance Win
**HPOS is one of the most significant performance improvements you can make for WooCommerce.** It stores orders in custom database tables instead of the WordPress posts table, dramatically improving performance for stores with many orders.
:::

**Benefits:**
- **Faster order queries** - Orders stored in optimized database structure
- **Reduced database load** - Separates orders from posts/pages
- **Better scalability** - Handles large numbers of orders efficiently
- **Improved admin performance** - Faster order management screens

**How to Enable:**
1. Go to `WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Features`
2. Enable "High-performance order storage"
3. Follow the migration process

## Server Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Regular Performance Checks

- **Weekly reviews** - Check logs for performance trends
- **Baseline measurements** - Record normal execution times
- **Peak time monitoring** - Monitor during high-traffic periods

### 2. Set Performance Alerts

Monitor for these warning signs:
- Execution times > 1000ms consistently
- Server load > 5.0 for extended periods
- Frequent timeout errors in logs

### 3. Capacity Planning

Track growth trends:
- **Record count growth** - Products, orders, customers
- **Performance degradation** - How execution time scales
- **Resource utilization** - CPU, memory, disk usage

## Server Optimization Strategies

### 1. WordPress/WooCommerce Best Practices

**Enable HPOS:**
- The single most impactful performance improvement for WooCommerce
- See the HPOS section above for details

**PHP Configuration (consult your host):**
```ini
memory_limit = 512M
max_execution_time = 300
max_input_vars = 3000
```

**WordPress Configuration:**
```php
// In wp-config.php - limit post revisions
define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3);

// Enable WordPress debug logging if needed
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

### 2. Hosting-Level Optimizations

**Object Caching:**
- Ask your host about Redis or Memcached availability
- Many managed WordPress hosts provide this automatically

**PHP Version:**
- Use PHP 8.0+ for significant performance improvements
- Most hosts allow easy PHP version switching

**Server Resources:**
- Ensure adequate RAM (minimum 1GB, preferably 2GB+)
- SSD storage provides much better database performance than traditional drives

## When to Seek Help

Contact your hosting provider or a WordPress developer if:

- **Server load consistently > 8.0** despite optimization efforts
- **Execution times > 5000ms** for simple operations
- **Memory errors** appearing frequently in logs
- **Database queries taking > 2 seconds** consistently

Provide them with:
- Server metrics from your logs
- List of active plugins
- Server specifications (CPU, RAM, storage type)
- WordPress and WooCommerce versions
