The Logs screen records system activity within the POS. It's an essential tool for debugging issues and understanding what's happening behind the scenes.

## Accessing Logs

Open the Logs screen from the left navigation drawer (the heartbeat icon).

## Interface Overview

### Search & Filter

- **Search Logs** - Find specific log entries by message content
- **Log Level filter** - Filter by log level (info, warn, error)
- **Display settings** - Configure visible columns

### Log Table

Each log entry shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time** | When the event occurred |
| **Level** | Severity: info (grey), warn (orange), error (red) |
| **Message** | Human-readable description of the event |
| **Context** | Expandable JSON with additional details |
| **Code** | Error code (links to documentation) |

## Log Levels

### Info (Grey)

Normal operations and successful events:
- "Fetched all IDs for products"
- "Synced new customers"
- "Fetched all IDs for taxes"

### Warning (Orange)

Non-critical issues that may need attention:
- "Unable to refresh session"
- "Retry attempt for sync"

### Error (Red)

Problems that need to be addressed:
- "Sorry, you cannot list resources" (permission issue)
- "API request failed"
- "Database sync error"

## Context Data

Click the expand arrow on any log entry to see detailed JSON context:

```json
{
  "total": "6",
  "execution_time": "54.79 ms",
  "server_load": "[10.51, 10.42, 9.98]"
}
```

This data includes:
- **Item counts** - How many records were affected
- **Execution time** - How long the operation took
- **Server load** - Server performance metrics
- **Request/response details** - For debugging API issues

## Error Codes

Many log entries include an **error code** (e.g., `API02004`, `DB01001`). These codes link directly to the [Error Codes](/error-codes) documentation, which provides:

- Detailed explanation of the error
- Common causes
- Troubleshooting steps

## Common Log Entries

### Sync Operations

```
[info] Fetched all IDs for products    {...} 3 items
[info] Synced new customers            {...} 1 item
[info] Fetched all IDs for taxes       {...} 3 items
```

These indicate normal sync activity. The context shows how many items were synced.

### Permission Errors

```
[error] Sorry, you cannot list resources    {...} API02004
```

This usually means the user doesn't have permission to access a resource. Check user roles in `WP Admin > POS > Settings > Access`.

### Session Issues

```
[warn] Unable to refresh session    {...} API02007
```

The POS couldn't refresh the authentication session. This may require logging out and back in.

## Using Logs for Support

When requesting support:

1. **Reproduce the issue** - Perform the action that causes the problem
2. **Check the logs** - Look for errors (red) or warnings (orange)
3. **Expand the context** - Get the full JSON details
4. **Note the error code** - Include this in your support request
5. **Copy relevant entries** - Share the log messages with context

## Performance Monitoring

Logs include execution time and server load metrics. If you notice:

- **High execution times** - Server may be overloaded or slow
- **High server load values** - Consider server optimisation
- **Frequent timeouts** - Check network connectivity
