1. **Hold down the modifier keys** (`Ctrl + Shift`)

3. **Release all keys** to execute the command

### Tips for Efficient Use

- **Memorize frequently used shortcuts**: Focus on learning the shortcuts for actions you perform most often
- **Practice the key combinations**: Regular use will help build muscle memory
- **Use shortcuts during busy periods**: Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up operations during peak hours
