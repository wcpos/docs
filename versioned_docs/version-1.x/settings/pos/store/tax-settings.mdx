:::warning Important
On initial load, the POS will get the default tax settings from WooCommerce. In general, users should keep the same settings as WooCommerce unless they have a specific need. Having different tax settings than the server will almost certainly cause the POS and WooCommerce to calculate different tax values, which can lead to discrepancies and problems with order synchronization.
:::

## Overview

The Tax Settings section allows you to configure how taxes are calculated and displayed in your POS application. These settings should typically match your WooCommerce tax configuration to ensure consistency between your online store and POS transactions.

## Tax Calculation Settings

This setting determines whether the prices you enter for products already include tax or if tax should be calculated on top of the entered price.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Yes, I will enter prices inclusive of tax** | Product prices include tax. The POS will calculate the tax amount by working backwards from the total price |
| **No, I will enter prices exclusive of tax** | Product prices do not include tax. The POS will add tax on top of the entered price |

### Calculate Tax Based On

This setting determines the address used for tax calculation purposes.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Customer shipping address** | Tax rates are determined based on where the customer's order will be shipped |
| **Customer billing address** | Tax rates are determined based on the customer's billing address |
| **Shop base address** | Tax rates are determined based on your store's physical location |

### Shipping Tax Class

Determines how shipping costs are taxed.

| **Zero rate** | No tax is applied to shipping costs |

### Rounding

Controls how tax amounts are rounded during calculation.

| Option | Description |

## Display Settings

### Display Prices in the Shop

Controls how prices are displayed to customers in the POS interface.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Including tax** | Prices shown include tax amounts |

Determines how prices are shown during the checkout process.

| Option | Description |

### Price Display Suffix

Text that appears after prices to indicate tax status.

- **When prices include tax**: Text shown when displaying tax-inclusive prices (e.g., "inc. VAT")
- **When prices exclude tax**: Text shown when displaying tax-exclusive prices (e.g., "ex. VAT")

### Display Tax Totals

Controls how tax information is presented in totals.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **As a single total** | All taxes are combined into one total line |
| **Itemized** | Each tax rate is shown as a separate line item |

## Restore Server Settings

The "Restore Server Settings" button allows you to fetch and apply the current WooCommerce tax settings from your server. This is useful when:

- You want to ensure your POS tax settings match your WooCommerce store exactly
- You've made changes to tax settings in WooCommerce and want to sync them to the POS
- You need to reset any custom POS tax settings back to the server defaults

:::tip Best Practice
Use "Restore Server Settings" regularly to keep your POS tax configuration in sync with your WooCommerce store, especially after making changes to tax settings in your WordPress admin.

## Important Considerations

### Consistency is Key

- **Display Confusion**: Inconsistent price display settings can confuse staff and customers

### Troubleshooting

If you notice discrepancies between POS and WooCommerce tax calculations:

1. **Check Settings Alignment**: Ensure all tax settings match between POS and WooCommerce
2. **Use Restore Server Settings**: Fetch the latest settings from WooCommerce
3. **Test Calculations**: Process test transactions to verify tax amounts
4. **Review Tax Rates**: Ensure tax rates are properly configured in WooCommerce
