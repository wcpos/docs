## Tips for Theme Selection

- **System Theme**: Ideal if you want the POS to match your device's appearance automatically
- **Light Theme**: Best for bright retail environments with good lighting
- **Dark Theme**: Perfect for dimly lit environments or evening/night shifts
- **Colored Themes (Ocean/Sunset)**: Great for adding personality and brand alignment
- **Monochrome**: Excellent for accessibility or when you need maximum contrast

The theme you select will persist across all your POS sessions, so you only need to set it once per device.
