:::info Pro Feature
The standalone Products page is only available for **Pro users** and provides advanced product management capabilities including stock management, price editing, and comprehensive product data viewing.
:::

## Overview

The Products page settings control the display and functionality of the dedicated Products management interface. Unlike the POS Products panel (which is used for adding products to the cart), this standalone page is designed for comprehensive product management tasks such as:

- **Stock Management**: View and edit inventory levels
- **Price Management**: Update product pricing
- **Product Data Editing**: Modify product information
- **Bulk Operations**: Perform actions on multiple products
- **Advanced Filtering**: Find products using detailed criteria

## Columns

The Columns section controls which data points and fields are displayed for each product in the standalone Products page. Each column can be toggled on or off, and many columns include additional "Display Options" for fine-tuning what information is shown.
