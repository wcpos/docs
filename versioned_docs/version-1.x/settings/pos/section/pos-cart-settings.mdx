Below is an explanation of each configurable setting and how it affects the display and behaviour of the cart within the point of sale application.

## Automatically show receipt after checkout

If enabled, the application will automatically display a receipt screen immediately after completing a sale, allowing staff to quickly review or share the final receipt.

## Automatically print receipt after checkout

If enabled, the application will immediately trigger a print when the receipt screen is shown. This saves time by reducing manual print steps.

## Quick Discounts

A comma-separated list of discount percentages that appear as quick shortcut buttons in the cart. 
For example, entering 5,10,15,20 adds four quick-discount buttons that apply a percentage discount to the entire order with a single click.

## Columns

The Columns section controls which data points are displayed for each item in the cart. 
Toggling a column on or off determines whether that information is shown. 
Within each column's "Display Options" you can choose to show or hide additional related details.

<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col style={{width: '20%'}} />
    <col style={{width: '40%'}} />
    <col style={{width: '40%'}} />
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Column</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Display Options</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Qty**</td>
      <td>Shows the quantity of each item in the cart</td>
      <td>• <strong>Split</strong>: If enabled, quantity splits can be displayed or managed, allowing items to be split into separate lines if needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Name**</td>
      <td>Shows the product name in the cart line item</td>
      <td>• <strong>SKU</strong>: If enabled, the product's SKU is shown below the name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Price**</td>
      <td>Shows the per-unit price of each item</td>
      <td>• <strong>On Sale</strong>: If enabled, the regular price is shown above the sale price, with a line through the regular price</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Regular Price**</td>
      <td>Shows the regular (non-discounted) price of each item</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Subtotal**</td>
      <td>Shows the line subtotal for each item (quantity × regular price)</td>
      <td>• <strong>Tax</strong>: If enabled, the tax calculated for the subtotal is displayed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Total**</td>
      <td>Shows the total for the line item</td>
      <td>• <strong>Tax</strong>: If enabled, the total tax portion is displayed within the total<br/>• <strong>On Sale</strong>: If enabled, the total regular price (before discounts) is shown with a line through it, highlighting that the total includes a discount</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Actions**</td>
      <td>Shows action buttons (e.g. remove item) for each cart line</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Restore Default Settings

Resets all toggles, quick discounts, and display options to their original default values. 
This is useful if the current configuration no longer meets requirements or needs a clean baseline.
