## Overview

The Reports page settings control the display of the Orders table within the Reports interface. This Pro feature is designed for **daily reconciliation** and allows you to:

- **Daily Sales Reconciliation**: View total sales broken down by payment method (cash, card, etc.)
- **Order Selection**: Choose which orders to include in report calculations
- **Payment Method Analysis**: See detailed breakdowns of sales by payment type
- **Date Range Reporting**: Generate reports for specific time periods
- **Order Filtering**: Filter orders by various criteria for accurate reporting

The settings primarily focus on customizing the Orders table columns to show or hide specific order information needed for reconciliation and reporting purposes.

## Orders Table Columns

The Columns section controls which data points and fields are displayed for each order in the Reports page Orders table. Each column can be toggled on or off, and some columns include additional "Display Options" for fine-tuning what information is shown.
