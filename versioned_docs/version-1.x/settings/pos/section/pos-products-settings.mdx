Below is an explanation of each configurable setting and how it affects the display and behaviour of products within the point of sale application.

## Show out-of-stock products

Controls whether products that are currently out of stock are displayed in the products list within the POS interface.

- **Enabled**: Out-of-stock products remain visible in the product list, allowing staff to see all products but preventing them from being added to the cart
- **Disabled**: Out-of-stock products are completely hidden from the product list, providing a cleaner view of only available items

This setting helps manage inventory visibility and can improve the shopping experience by reducing clutter or maintaining awareness of stock levels.

## Columns

The Columns section controls which data points and fields are displayed for each product in the POS interface. Each column can be toggled on or off, and many columns include additional "Display Options" for fine-tuning what information is shown.

## Meta Data Keys

This field allows you to specify a comma-separated list of product meta data keys that should be automatically transferred from the product's `meta_data` to the order line item's `meta_data` when the product is added to a cart and processed as an order.

### Purpose

This feature is essential for integration with plugins that store additional product information in custom meta fields. When these products are sold through the POS, the meta data needs to be preserved in the order for proper functionality.

### Common Use Cases

- **Bottle Deposit Plugins**: Products with deposit fees stored in meta data
- **Custom Product Fields**: Additional product specifications or attributes
- **Third-party Integrations**: Data required by external systems or plugins
- **Compliance Information**: Regulatory or tracking data that must follow the product through the sale

### Example

If you have a bottle deposit plugin that stores deposit amounts in a meta field called `_bottle_deposit`, you would enter:

```
_bottle_deposit
```

For multiple meta keys, separate them with commas:

```
_bottle_deposit,_custom_field,_tracking_code
```

### Important Notes

- Only the meta keys you specify will be transferred to the order
- Meta keys are case-sensitive and should match exactly as stored in the product meta data
- This ensures that plugin functionality dependent on product meta data continues to work correctly for POS orders

## Restore Default Settings

Resets all column toggles, display options, and meta data keys to their original default values. This is useful if the current configuration no longer meets requirements or needs a clean baseline.
