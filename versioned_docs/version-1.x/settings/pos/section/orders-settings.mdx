## Overview

The Orders page settings control the display and functionality of the dedicated Orders management interface. This Pro feature allows you to:

- **Order Lookup**: Quickly find and view past orders
- **Order Management**: Re-open completed orders for modifications
- **Receipt Reprinting**: Generate receipts for historical orders
- **Order Analysis**: Review order details, customer information, and payment methods
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search orders by various criteria

The settings primarily focus on customizing the data table columns to show or hide specific order information based on your business needs.

The Columns section controls which data points and fields are displayed for each order in the Orders page. Each column can be toggled on or off, and some columns include additional "Display Options" for fine-tuning what information is shown.
