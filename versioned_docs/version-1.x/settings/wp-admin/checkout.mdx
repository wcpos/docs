The Checkout Settings page (`WP Admin > POS > Settings > Checkout`) controls which payment gateways appear in the POS and how orders are processed.

## Payment Gateways

This section lists all WooCommerce payment gateways installed on your site. Each gateway can be independently enabled or disabled for the POS.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Toggle the gateway on or off for POS checkout |
| **Gateway** | The payment gateway name |
| **Gateway ID** | The WooCommerce gateway identifier (useful for developers) |

### Enabling a Gateway

1. Find the gateway in the list
2. Toggle the **Enabled** switch on
3. The gateway will appear at POS checkout on the next page load

### Reordering Gateways

Drag gateways to change their display order in the POS checkout. The first enabled gateway is selected by default when a cashier opens the checkout modal.

### POS vs Online Store

Gateway settings here are **independent** of your WooCommerce payment settings. A gateway can be:

- **Enabled for POS, disabled online** — useful for cash payments which don't apply to web orders
- **Enabled online, disabled for POS** — useful for gateways like PayPal that aren't practical for in-person sales
- **Enabled for both** — the gateway works everywhere

:::note
A gateway must first be installed and active in `WP Admin > WooCommerce > Settings > Payments` before it appears in the POS checkout settings list. If a gateway is missing, check that the plugin is installed and the gateway is enabled in WooCommerce.

## Order Status

Configure the default order status for completed POS orders. By default, POS orders are set to **Completed** since payment is collected at the point of sale.
