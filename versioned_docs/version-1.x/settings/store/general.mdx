## Overview

On initial load, the POS automatically retrieves default settings from your WooCommerce store configuration. In most cases, you'll want to keep these settings synchronized with your WooCommerce store to maintain consistency across all sales channels.

:::tip Best Practice
Generally, users should maintain the same settings as their WooCommerce store unless there's a specific business need to customize them for the POS, such as switching currencies for a different market or setting a different default customer for in-store transactions.
:::

## Store Information

### Store Name

The name of your store as it appears throughout the POS interface and on receipts. This is typically synchronized with your WooCommerce store name.

### Store Address

The store address fields include:

- **Store Base City**: The city where your store is located
- **Store Base Postcode**: The postal/ZIP code for your store location
- **Store Base State**: The state or province where your store operates
- **Store Base Country**: The country where your store is located

:::warning Address Settings Disabled
The store address fields are currently disabled in the POS settings because changes to the store address can impact tax calculations and may cause problems with order processing. These settings remain synchronized with your WooCommerce store configuration.

### Thousand Separator

The character used to separate thousands in large numbers (e.g., "," for 1,000 or "." for 1.000).
