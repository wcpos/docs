Store Settings are app-wide configurations that affect how the POS operates. These settings apply to the entire store, not individual screens.

## Accessing Store Settings

Open the Store Settings by:

- Clicking the **user menu** (top-right corner) and selecting **Settings**
- Using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + S`

## Settings Tabs

The Store Settings modal contains these tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [General](/settings/store/general) | Store info, language, currency, default customer |
| [Tax](/settings/store/tax) | Tax calculation and display options |
| [Barcode](/settings/store/barcode) | Barcode scanner configuration |
| [Keyboard Shortcuts](/settings/store/hotkeys) | Available keyboard shortcuts |
