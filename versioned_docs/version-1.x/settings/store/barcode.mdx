## How Barcode Detection Works

Most barcode scanners behave like a keyboard connected to your device. When you scan a barcode, the POS detects that the characters were entered faster than normal typing. It uses these "fast key presses" to identify the input as a barcode scan.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Average input time** | How fast the input should be (in milliseconds) to count as a barcode. Lower values = faster input required |
| **Minimum length** | How long the continuous string of characters must be to be treated as a barcode |
| **Prefix removal** | Characters to remove from the beginning of scanned barcodes |
| **Suffix removal** | Characters to remove from the end of scanned barcodes |

## Prefix/Suffix Removal

If your scanner adds extra characters (like a prefix or suffix), you can remove them automatically so only the main barcode remains.

**Example:** If your scanner adds "A" before every barcode and "Z" after, configure:
- Prefix removal: `A`
- Suffix removal: `Z`

## Troubleshooting

### Barcode not detected

- **Scanner too slow**: Try increasing the "Average input time" value
- **Barcode too short**: Try decreasing the "Minimum length" value
- **Extra characters**: Check if your scanner is adding prefixes/suffixes

### Regular typing detected as barcode

- **Typing too fast**: Try decreasing the "Average input time" value
- **Input too long**: Try increasing the "Minimum length" value
