title: Accessing the POS
---

To control access to the WooCommerce POS functionality, you can utilize WordPress capabilities and user roles. By assigning specific roles to users and configuring their capabilities, you can tailor the access levels for different POS users. The WooCommerce POS plugin integrates with the existing WordPress roles and introduces a specific role for cashiers.

The following table outlines the main user roles in the POS and their respective capabilities:

| Role          | Created By      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrator | WordPress       | The site owner who has all capabilities enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Shop Manager  | WooCommerce     | This role is designed for users who need access to the POS and the ability to manage POS settings. Shop Managers may not have permission to install plugins or perform other administrative tasks.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Cashier       | WooCommerce POS | This role is added by the WooCommerce POS plugin and is intended for users who will primarily use the POS. Cashiers typically have limited capabilities and may not have access to WP Admin to modify POS settings, install plugins, or create blog posts. In some cases, you may even want to restrict a cashier from adding or editing customers in the POS. |

To assign and manage user roles and capabilities, you can navigate to **`WP Admin > POS > Access`**.
