:::info Pro Feature
The Customers screen requires [WCPOS Pro](/getting-started/pro-license). Free users can select existing customers for orders but cannot view the full customer list or edit customer details.
:::

The Customers screen provides comprehensive customer management directly within the POS. View, edit, and create customers without switching to the WooCommerce admin.
