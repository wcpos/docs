The **WooCommerce REST API** is like a set of standardised “channels” that allows store owners to connect their WooCommerce store to other applications and services.

Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. It acts as a bridge between your WooCommerce store and external applications, allowing them to communicate and share data.

2. The API works by sending requests to specific **endpoints** - think of these as "channels" for different types of store data. For example, there are endpoints for products, orders, and customers.

3. External applications can use these endpoints to:
  - Get information (like fetching a list of products)
  - Add new data (like creating a new order)
  - Update existing information (like changing a product's price)
  - Delete data (like removing an outdated product)

Instead of relying on PHP hooks and filters (like many traditional WordPress plugins do), it works by sending and receiving data in a structured, predictable format, known as **JSON**.

## Viewing the JSON Data in the POS

To help you understand what the POS is “seeing,” we’ve included a JSON view in many parts of the interface. 
For example, when you edit the order meta or a cart line item in the POS, you’ll see a JSON tab (like in the screenshot below).

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Editing a line item in the POS"
    img="/img/edit-line-item.png"
    height={400}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">

  </p>
</div>

The browser also includes a Network Inspector, a tool that lets you monitor the data being sent and received between your browser and the server, including JSON data.

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Network Inspector in the browser"
    img="/img/network-inspector.png"
  />
  <p class="image-caption">

  </p>
</div>

## Why Don’t Some Plugins Work in the POS?

WooCommerce POS downloads the product, order, and customer data from your WooCommerce store through the REST API. 
It then keeps a local copy of that data so it can continue running even if your internet connection is spotty. 
This approach makes the POS faster and more reliable in a busy checkout environment.

However, this means our POS doesn’t “see” changes that happen dynamically on your site in real-time. For example:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style={{width: "200px"}}>Plugin Type</th>
    <th>Why It Doesn't Work</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dynamic Pricing</td>
    <td>If another plugin on your store calculates a unique price for each logged-in customer, the POS won't automatically get that personalised price.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product Add-ons</td>
    <td>If another plugin on your store adds extra product data, the POS won't automatically get that data. The POS only gets the data that's exposed through the REST API.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
