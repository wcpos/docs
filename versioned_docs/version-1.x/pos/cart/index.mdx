The Cart Panel is the right side of the POS screen where you manage the current order. Here you can view items, edit quantities and prices, select customers, and proceed to checkout.

## Interface Overview

### Customer Selector

At the top of the Cart Panel:

- **Customer badge** - Shows the current customer (e.g., "Guest" or customer name)
- **Add customer icon** (<Icon name="plus" />) - Create a new customer
- **Display settings** (<Icon name="sliders" />) - Configure cart columns and options

Click the customer badge to search for and select a different customer.

### Line Items

The main area displays items in the current order:

- **QTY** - Quantity (editable)
- **Name** - Product name with variation attributes
- **Price** - Unit price (editable)
- **Total** - Line total

See [Line Items](/pos/cart/line-items) for details on editing.

### Add to Cart Options

Below the line items, you can add special items:

- **Add Miscellaneous Product** - Add a custom item with manual price entry
- **Add Fee** - Add a fee line (e.g., gift wrapping, service charge)
- **Add Shipping** - Add a shipping line with manual cost entry

:::note Line Item Types
WooCommerce uses three types of line items: `line_item` (products), `fee_line` (fees), and `shipping_line` (shipping). Currently, only manual entry is supported for shipping—the POS does not calculate shipping costs automatically.

### Order Summary

- **Subtotal** - Total before taxes and fees
- **Tax** - Calculated tax amount (if applicable)
- **Total** - Final order total

- **Order Meta** - Add custom metadata or view JSON
- **Save to Server** - Save the order to WooCommerce with status `pos-open`

### Main Buttons

### Open Orders

At the very bottom, a carousel shows all open orders:

- Each cart displays its total

## Display Settings

Click the sliders icon (<Icon name="sliders" />) to customise the Cart Panel display.

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Cart Settings"
    img="/img/pos-cart-settings.png"

  />
  <p class="image-caption">Cart Panel Display Settings</p>

### Automatically Show Receipt After Checkout

If enabled, the receipt screen displays automatically after completing a sale.

### Automatically Print Receipt After Checkout

If enabled, the receipt prints automatically when shown. This saves time by reducing manual print steps.

### Quick Discounts

A comma-separated list of discount percentages that appear as quick shortcut buttons.

For example, entering `5,10,15,20` adds four buttons that apply percentage discounts to the entire order with a single click.

### Columns

Configure which columns appear in the cart:

| Column | Description | Display Options |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Qty** | Quantity of each item | Split (allow splitting items) |
| **Name** | Product name | SKU |
| **Price** | Per-unit price | On Sale indicator |
| **Regular Price** | Non-discounted price | - |
| **Subtotal** | Line subtotal (qty × price) | Tax amount |
| **Total** | Line total | Tax amount, On Sale indicator |
| **Actions** | Remove item button | - |

### Restore Default Settings
