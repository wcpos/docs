WCPOS provides several ways to discount an order, from quick percentage buttons to WooCommerce coupon codes. This page covers all of them.

## Quick Discounts

Quick discount buttons let you apply a percentage discount to the entire order with a single tap.

To configure them, open the cart [Display Settings](/pos/cart#display-settings) and enter a comma-separated list of percentages in the **Quick Discounts** field. For example, `5,10,15,20` creates four shortcut buttons.

When you tap a quick discount button, the percentage is applied across all line items in the cart.

## Line-Item Discounts

You can change the price of any individual line item directly in the cart:

1. Click the **Price** field on the line item
2. Enter the new price
3. Press **Enter** to confirm

This is useful for price matching, staff discounts, or one-off adjustments. The line item's total updates automatically based on quantity × new price.

See [Line Items](/pos/cart/line-items) for more on editing cart items.

:::tip Splitting Items
If a customer wants different discounts on portions of the same product (e.g., 3 at full price and 2 discounted), enable the **Split** option in cart [Display Settings](/pos/cart#display-settings) to break a line item into separate lines.

## Order-Level Discounts

To apply a flat discount to the entire order (rather than individual items), add a **negative fee**:

1. Click **Add Fee** below the cart items
2. Enter a name (e.g., "Staff discount")
3. Enter the discount amount as a negative number (e.g., `-5.00`)

The fee appears as a separate line item and reduces the order total. You can edit the fee's tax status using the three-dot menu if needed.

## Coupon Codes

WooCommerce coupon codes can be applied at checkout:

1. Click **Checkout** to open the checkout modal
2. Enter the coupon code in the **Coupon code** field
3. Click **Apply coupon**
4. The discount appears in the order summary

Coupons must be set up in WooCommerce first (`WP Admin > Marketing > Coupons`). All standard WooCommerce coupon types work — percentage discounts, fixed cart discounts, fixed product discounts, and so on.

## POS Discounts vs WooCommerce Coupons

These are two different mechanisms, and it's worth understanding the distinction:

| | POS Discounts | WooCommerce Coupons |
|---|---|---|
| **How applied** | Edit the line item price or add a negative fee | Enter a coupon code at checkout |
| **Where configured** | On the fly by the cashier | Pre-configured in WP Admin |
| **Tracking** | Shows as a price change on the line item | Tracked as a coupon in WooCommerce reports |
| **Restrictions** | None — the cashier sets any price | Supports usage limits, product restrictions, minimum spend, expiry dates |
| **Best for** | Ad-hoc adjustments, price matching | Structured promotions, trackable discounts |

If you need to track discount usage in WooCommerce reports or enforce rules like usage limits, use coupons. If you just need a quick one-off price adjustment, POS discounts are simpler.

## How POS Discounts Interact with Coupons

When a cashier sets a custom price on a line item (e.g., reducing $18 to $16), this is treated as a "POS discount". If a coupon is then applied, the coupon calculates against the POS-discounted price ($16), not the original price ($18).

- The order subtotal still shows the original price for display purposes.
- When a coupon is removed, the line item returns to the POS-discounted price.
- POS-discounted items are treated as "on sale" by WooCommerce. If a coupon has **exclude sale items** enabled, it will skip POS-discounted items — the same way WooCommerce treats regular sale items.

## Known Limitations

- **No automatic discount rules** — the POS doesn't support "buy 2, get 1 free" style automatic discounts. Use WooCommerce coupons for structured promotions.
- **Quick discounts are percentage-only** — there's no built-in quick button for fixed-amount discounts. Use a negative fee or edit individual prices instead.
- **Coupon validation happens server-side** — if your site is unreachable, coupons can't be applied. POS discounts (price edits) work regardless of connectivity.
