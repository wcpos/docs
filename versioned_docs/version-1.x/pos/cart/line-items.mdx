Every item in the cart is a line item that can be edited directly. WCPOS provides flexible inline editing for quantities, prices, and other details.

## Line Item Types

WooCommerce uses three types of line items:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **line_item** | Products from your catalogue | T-shirt, Coffee mug |
| **fee_line** | Additional fees | Gift wrapping, Service charge |
| **shipping_line** | Shipping costs | Standard shipping, Express delivery |

:::note
Shipping costs are entered manually. The POS does not calculate shipping rates automatically.

### Product Name

For miscellaneous products and fees, you can edit the name directly by clicking on it.

### Price

Click the price field to change the unit price. This is useful for:

- Applying manual discounts
- Price matching
- Correcting pricing errors

The total updates automatically based on quantity × price.

### Three-Dot Menu

Click the **⋮** (three dots) on any line item to access additional options:

#### Edit Form

Opens a detailed edit form for the line item, allowing you to modify all fields.

#### Raw JSON View

Displays the raw JSON data for the line item. This is extremely helpful for:

- **Debugging** - See exactly what data is being sent to WooCommerce
- **Troubleshooting** - Identify issues with custom fields or meta data
- **Development** - Understand the data structure for integrations

### Remove Item

Click the red **×** button to remove an item from the cart.

## Variation Attributes

For variable products, the selected variation attributes display below the product name:

```
Hoodie
Colour: Green
Size: Large
```

These attributes are part of the line item data and are included in the order.

## Meta Data

If you've configured [Meta Data Keys](/pos/product-panel#meta-data-keys) in the Product Panel settings, that data is automatically copied to the line item when the product is added to the cart.

You can view this meta data in the Raw JSON view.

## Splitting Line Items

If enabled in [Display Settings](/pos/cart#display-settings), you can split a line item into multiple lines. This is useful when a customer wants to apply different discounts to portions of the same product.

## Tips

### Keyboard Navigation
