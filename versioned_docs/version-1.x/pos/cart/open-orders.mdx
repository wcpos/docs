WCPOS allows you to work with multiple orders simultaneously. This is useful for handling customer holds, switching between transactions, and recovering from interruptions.

## Open Orders Carousel

At the bottom of the Cart Panel, a horizontal carousel displays all open orders:

{/* Screenshot: open-orders-carousel.png */}

- Each cart shows its **total amount**
- The **current order** is highlighted
- Click any cart to switch to it
- Scroll left/right to see more carts

## Creating a New Order

A new empty cart is always available. Simply click on an empty cart in the carousel or start adding products when the current cart is empty.

## Switching Between Orders

Click on any order in the carousel to switch to it. The Cart Panel updates to show the selected order's contents.

**Use cases:**

- Customer steps away to get another item
- Need to help a quick customer while a large order is in progress
- Comparing prices or items between orders

## Saving Orders to Server

Orders exist in two states:

### Local Only

By default, new orders are stored only in the local browser/app database. They will persist across page refreshes but:

- Are not visible in WooCommerce admin
- Will be lost if the local database is cleared
- Are not accessible from other devices

### Saved to Server

Click **Save to Server** to create a WooCommerce order with the status `pos-open`. This:

- Creates a real order in WooCommerce
- Persists even if the local database is cleared
- Can be accessed from other devices
- Appears in WP Admin > WooCommerce > Orders

:::tip When to Save
Save orders to the server when:
- A customer wants to hold an order for later pickup
- You're ending your shift and another cashier will continue
- You want a backup in case of app/browser issues
:::

## Recovering Saved Orders

If you've saved orders to the server, they can be accessed again by:

1. Opening the **Orders** screen (Pro feature)
2. Filtering by status `pos-open`
3. Reopening the order

## Order Persistence

### Local Storage

WCPOS uses IndexedDB to store orders locally. This provides:

- Persistence across browser sessions
- Fast access without network requests
- Offline capability

### Sync with Server

When you save to server or checkout:

- The order is sent to WooCommerce
- A confirmation is received
- Local and server data are synchronized

## Voiding Orders

To remove an open order:

1. Switch to the order you want to remove
2. Click the **Void** button

**What happens:**

- **Unsaved orders:** Permanently deleted from the local database
- **Saved orders:** Moved to Trash in WooCommerce and deleted locally

To recover a voided saved order:
1. Go to `WP Admin > WooCommerce > Orders > Trash`
2. Restore the order

## Tips

### Keep Orders Organized

With multiple open orders, it helps to:

- Add customer names to orders for easy identification
- Add order notes describing the hold reason
- Save important orders to the server

### Shift Handoffs

When ending a shift with open orders:

1. Save all important orders to the server
2. Add order notes explaining the status
3. The next cashier can access them from the Orders screen

### Offline Considerations

If you lose connectivity:

- Local orders remain accessible and you can continue adding items
- You cannot complete/checkout orders until connectivity is restored
- You cannot save orders to the server until reconnected
- You cannot create new customers until reconnected
