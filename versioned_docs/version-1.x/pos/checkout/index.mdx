## Processing Payment

1. Select a payment method
2. For cash, enter the amount tendered
3. Click **Process Payment**
4. The order is completed and the [receipt](/pos/checkout/receipts) is shown

## Checkout Settings (Troubleshooting)

The checkout modal uses an iframe/webview to display the WooCommerce Order Pay page. This leverages WooCommerce's existing payment infrastructure, meaning any payment gateway that works with WooCommerce should work in the POS.

However, theme and plugin scripts can sometimes interfere. Click **Checkout Settings** to troubleshoot:

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Checkout Settings in the Checkout Modal"
    img="/img/checkout-settings.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: 600 }}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">Checkout Settings in the Checkout Modal</p>
</div>

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Form to disable all styles and scripts"
    img="/img/disable-styles-and-scripts.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: 600 }}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">Form to disable all styles and scripts</p>
</div>

### Disable All Styles and Scripts

:::warning Nuclear Option
This is the nuclear option and should only be used for testing or in rare cases where the developer knows what they are doing. Disabling all wp_head scripts will remove even the WooCommerce scripts necessary to expand/contract the payment gateways, potentially breaking payment functionality.
:::

- **Disable wp_head** - Removes all scripts/styles from the WordPress header
- **Disable wp_footer** - Removes all scripts/styles from the WordPress footer

### Disable Selected Styles

Selectively disable CSS that may cause display issues:

- wp-emoji-styles
- wp-block-library
- classic-theme-styles
- woocommerce-layout
- woocommerce-smallscreen
- woocommerce-general
- etc.

### Disable Selected Scripts

Selectively disable JavaScript that may interfere with payment gateways:

- wc-add-to-cart
- selectWoo
- wc-checkout
- woocommerce
- html5shiv
- etc.

:::tip
If a payment gateway doesn't display correctly:

1. Try disabling theme styles first
2. Then try disabling WooCommerce scripts that aren't needed
3. Be careful not to disable scripts required by your payment gateway
   :::

## Cancel

Click **Cancel** to close the checkout modal without completing the order. The order remains as an open cart.
