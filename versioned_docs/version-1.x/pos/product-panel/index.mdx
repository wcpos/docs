## Interface Overview

### Search Bar

At the top of the panel, the search bar lets you quickly find products by:

- **Product name** - Type any part of the product name
- **SKU** - Search by Stock Keeping Unit

See [Search & Filtering](/pos/product-panel/search-filtering) for detailed information.

### Display Settings

Click the **sliders icon** (<Icon name="sliders" />) next to the search bar to open Display Settings. This allows you to customise which columns and information are shown in the product list.

### Filter Buttons

Below the search bar, filter buttons let you narrow down products:

- **In Stock** - Show only products with available inventory

- **On Sale** - Show products currently on sale
- **Category** - Filter by product category
- **Tag** - Filter by product tag

Active filters appear highlighted. Click a filter again to remove it.

- **Variable products** show a green <Icon name="circle-arrow-right" color="green" /> arrow to open the variation selector

See [Variable Products](/pos/product-panel/variations) for more details.

### Footer

At the bottom of the Product Panel:

- **Tax status** - Shows the current tax calculation basis (e.g., "Tax based on: Shop base address"). Click to view active tax rates.

## Adding Products to Cart

### Simple Products

Click the green <Icon name="circle-plus" color="green" /> button to add a simple product to the cart. Each click adds one more unit.

### Variable Products

Variable products (e.g., a t-shirt with size and colour options) show a green <Icon name="circle-arrow-right" color="green" /> arrow. Click to:

1. **Quick popover** - Select variation from a dropdown
2. **Expand inline** - Click "Expand" to see all variations in the list

See [Variable Products](/pos/product-panel/variations) for more details.

### Barcode Scanning

Connect a USB or Bluetooth barcode scanner to quickly add products. When you scan a barcode, WCPOS automatically searches for and adds the matching product.

See [Barcode Scanning](/pos/product-panel/barcode-scanning) for setup instructions.

## Why Can't I See Some Products?

If products are missing from your Product Panel, check:

- **POS visibility** - Products set to "Online Only" won't appear in the POS. See [POS Only Products](/products/pos-only-products).
- **Stock settings** - If "Show Out-of-Stock Products" is disabled in Display Settings, out-of-stock items are hidden.
- **Sync status** - New or recently updated products may need a sync. Long press the sync button and select **"Clear and Refresh"**.
- **Filters** - Check if you have active filters (Category, Tag, etc.) that might be hiding products.
