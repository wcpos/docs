Variable products in WooCommerce are products that have multiple options, such as different sizes, colors, or materials. WCPOS provides several ways to work with variable products efficiently.

## Identifying Variable Products

In the Product Panel, variable products are distinguished by:

- **Arrow button** (<Icon name="circle-arrow-right" color="green" />) instead of the plus button (<Icon name="circle-plus" color="green" />) used for simple products
- **Attribute options** displayed below the product name (e.g., "Colour: Blue, Green, Red")
- **"Expand" link** to view all variations inline

## Adding Variable Products to Cart

### Method 1: Quick Popover

Click the green <Icon name="circle-arrow-right" color="green" /> arrow button on a variable product to open a popover with dropdown menus for each attribute:

1. Click the <Icon name="circle-arrow-right" color="green" /> button
2. Select options from each dropdown (e.g., Size: Large, Colour: Blue)
3. The matching variation is added to the cart

This is the fastest method when you know exactly which variation you need.

### Method 2: Expand Inline

Click the **"Expand"** link on a variable product to show all its variations directly in the product list:

1. Click **Expand** below the product name
2. All variations appear as separate rows beneath the parent product
3. Click the <Icon name="circle-plus" color="green" /> button on any variation to add it to the cart
4. Click **Collapse** to hide the variations again

This method is useful when you want to see all available options, their individual stock levels, and prices.

### Method 3: Barcode Scanning

Each product variation can have its own unique barcode. When you scan a variation's barcode:

- If exactly one variation matches, it's added directly to the cart
- If multiple variations share the barcode, the search bar shows matching results

See [Barcode Scanning](/pos/product-panel/barcode-scanning) for more details.

## Variation Information

Each variation can display:

- **Variation attributes** - The specific options for this variation (e.g., "Size: Large, Colour: Blue")
- **SKU** - Unique identifier for the variation (may differ from parent product)
- **Stock quantity** - Individual stock level for the variation
- **Price** - Variations can have different prices than the parent or each other

## Variations in the Cart

When a variation is added to the cart, it displays:

- **Product name** from the parent product
- **Variation attributes** below the name
- **Price** for that specific variation

You can edit the line item just like any other product in the cart.

## Tips for Efficient Variation Selection

### Use Barcode Scanning

If your variations have individual barcodes (recommended), scanning is the fastest way to add them to the cart.

### Configure Display Options

In the Product Panel [Display Settings](/pos/product-panel#display-settings), enable the **Attributes** option to show variation attributes directly in the product list without expanding.

### Keyboard Navigation

When the variation popover is open, you can use keyboard arrow keys to navigate options and Enter to select.

## F.A.Q.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem question="Why can't I see a specific variation?">

Check that the variation:
- Is published and not in draft status
- Is set to "In Stock" or has stock quantity > 0 (if stock management is enabled)
- Has all required attributes defined

Also ensure you haven't filtered out the product with the "In Stock" filter if the variation is out of stock.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem question="How do I add barcodes to individual variations?">

In WooCommerce, edit the variable product and expand each variation. You can add a unique barcode to each variation's barcode field (typically `_sku` or `_global_unique_id` depending on your configuration).
