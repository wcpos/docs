The POS screen is the main interface for selling products. It's where you'll spend most of your time when using WCPOS.

## Screen Layout

### Header

The header bar displays:

- **Store name** - The name of your connected WooCommerce store
- **Connectivity indicator** - Green dot when connected to the server, yellow/red when offline
- **User menu** - Click to access settings, switch users, or log out

### Navigation Drawer

The left sidebar provides quick access to all main screens:

| Icon | Screen | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 🏪 | **POS** | Main selling interface (you are here) |
| 📦 | **Products** | Inventory management (Pro) |
| 📋 | **Orders** | Order history (Pro) |
| 👥 | **Customers** | Customer management (Pro) |
| 📊 | **Reports** | Sales reports (Pro) |
| 📝 | **Logs** | System logs for debugging |
| ❓ | **Support** | Discord support channel |

The version number is displayed at the bottom of the drawer.

## Responsive Layout

WCPOS adapts to different screen sizes:

### Desktop / Tablet (Large Screens)

On larger screens, the POS displays a **two-column layout**:

- **Left column:** Product Panel - search and browse products
- **Right column:** Cart Panel - view and manage the current order

The columns are **resizable** - drag the divider between them to adjust the proportions.

### Mobile (Small Screens)

On smaller screens, the POS uses a **tab-based layout**:

- **Products tab:** Browse and add products to cart
- **Cart tab:** View cart, manage line items, and checkout

Switch between tabs using the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

WCPOS supports keyboard shortcuts for faster operation. Access the full list via the Settings modal or see [Keyboard Shortcuts](/settings/store/hotkeys).

Common shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + F` | Focus search bar |
| `Ctrl + Shift + S` | Open Settings |
| `Escape` | Close modal/dialogue |

## Connectivity

The green indicator in the header shows your connection status:

- **Red** - Offline mode

While offline, you can still browse cached products and customers, and start new orders. Completing orders requires connectivity.
