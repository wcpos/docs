:::info Pro Feature
The Products screen requires [WCPOS Pro](/getting-started/pro-license). Free users can view and add products to cart from the [POS Product Panel](/pos/product-panel), but cannot edit inventory or prices.
:::

The Products screen is a dedicated inventory management interface. Unlike the [POS Product Panel](/pos/product-panel) (which is for selling), this screen is designed for managing your product catalogue.
