POS Only Products is a feature that lets you control whether products appear in your online store, your POS, or both. This is useful when you have different product catalogues for online and in-store sales.

## Overview

When enabled, each product gets a **POS Visibility** setting with three options:

| Visibility | Online Store | POS |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| **POS & Online** (default) | Visible | Visible |
| **POS Only** | Hidden | Visible |
| **Online Only** | Visible | Hidden |

## When to Use This Feature

Enable POS Only Products if you need to:

- **Sell in-store exclusives** - Products only available when customers visit your physical store
- **Hide online-only items from POS** - Digital products, pre-orders, or items that shouldn't be sold in-store
- **Manage different catalogues** - Separate product ranges for online and retail channels
- **Control promotional items** - In-store-only specials or online-exclusive deals

:::tip
If all your products should appear in both channels, you don't need this feature. Leave it disabled for better performance.
:::

## Enabling the Feature

1. Go to **WP Admin → WCPOS → Settings → General**
2. Enable **"Enable POS Only Products"**
3. Save changes

For more details on General Settings, see [WP Admin General Settings](/settings/wp-admin/general).

:::warning Performance Impact
Only enable this setting if you need it. When enabled, it adds an extra database lookup for every product request, which can impact performance on stores with large catalogues.

## Setting Product Visibility

### Individual Products

To set visibility for a single product:

1. Go to **WP Admin → Products** and edit a product
2. In the **Product data** panel, look for **POS Visibility**
3. Select your desired option:
   - **POS & Online** - Product appears everywhere (default)
   - **POS Only** - Product hidden from online store
   - **Online Only** - Product hidden from POS
4. Click **Update** to save

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="POS Visibility setting in the product data panel"
    img="/img/pos-only-products.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: 400 }}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">POS Visibility setting in the Product data panel</p>
</div>

### Bulk Editing

To change visibility for multiple products at once:

1. Go to **WP Admin → Products**
2. Select the products you want to modify using the checkboxes
3. From the **Bulk actions** dropdown, select **Edit**
4. Click **Apply**
5. In the bulk edit panel, find the **POS Visibility** dropdown
6. Select your desired visibility option
7. Click **Update**

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="Bulk editing POS visibility for multiple products"
    img="/img/bulk-edit-pos-only-products.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: 500 }}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">Bulk editing POS visibility from the Products list</p>
</div>

### Variable Products

For variable products, you can set visibility at both the parent product level and for each individual variation. This gives you fine-grained control - for example, you could show all variations online but only certain colours or sizes in-store.

<div class="image-container">
  <Image
    alt="POS Visibility settings for individual variations"
    img="/img/pos-only-variations.png"
    style={{ maxHeight: 300 }}
  />
  <p class="image-caption">Each variation has its own POS Visibility setting</p>
</div>

## How It Affects the POS

When a product is set to **Online Only**:

- It won't appear in the [Product Panel](/pos/product-panel)
- It won't be found via search or barcode scanning
- It cannot be added to cart in the POS

When a product is set to **POS Only**:

- It won't appear on your WooCommerce store frontend
- It won't be included in online search results
- Customers cannot purchase it online

:::note
If you've recently changed a product's visibility and it's still appearing (or not appearing) in the POS, try a sync. Long press the sync button and select **"Clear and Refresh"** to reload all product data.
