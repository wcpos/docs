## Product Search

### Unified Search Field

WooCommerce POS features a single search field that simultaneously searches across multiple product attributes:

- **Product Name** - Searches the product title and description
- **SKU** - Matches product postmeta `_sku` field
- **Barcode** - Searches configured barcode field, which can be any postmeta field. The legacy setting is `_sku`, but this will be changed to `_global_unique_id` in the future.

Simply type your search term into the "Search Products" field, and the POS will instantly filter results across all these fields.

### Tokenized Search Technology

The search functionality uses the [FlexSearch library](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) with advanced tokenization capabilities:

- **Forward Tokenization** - Matches partial words from the beginning (e.g., searching "blue" will find "blueberry")
- **Performance Optimized** - Uses a performance preset for fast search results
- **Language Aware** - Adapts to your store's configured language
- **Lazy Initialization** - Optimizes memory usage by loading search indexes only when needed

### How Search Works

When you type in the search field, the POS:

1. **Tokenizes** your input into searchable terms
2. **Searches locally** stored product data first for instant results
3. **Queries the server** if no local matches are found, then downloads and stores new products for future searches
4. **Updates results** in real-time as you type

This approach ensures fast search performance while progressively building a complete local product database.

## Product Filtering

### Filter Bar

Below the search field, you'll find interactive filter toggles and dropdown menus that allow you to narrow down products by specific criteria.

### Available Filters

#### Stock Status
Filter products based on their inventory status:
- **In Stock** - Products with available inventory
- **Out of Stock** - Products with zero inventory
- **Backorder** - Products available for backorder

#### Featured Products
Toggle to show only products marked as "Featured" in your WooCommerce store.

#### On Sale Products  
Filter to display only products currently on sale or with active discounts.

#### Category
Use the category dropdown to filter products by their assigned product categories. This helps you quickly find products within specific departments or product lines.

#### Tag
Filter by product tags to find items with specific attributes or characteristics you've defined in your WooCommerce store.

### Using Filters

- **Toggle Filters** - Click any filter button to activate it (active filters appear highlighted)
- **Multiple Filters** - You can combine multiple filters to narrow your search further
- **Clear Filters** - Click an active filter again to deactivate it
- **Search + Filter** - Use filters together with the search field for precise product location

## Barcode Configuration

### Search Fields

The search functionality automatically includes your configured barcode field. The barcode field used for searching depends on your POS settings configuration.

## F.A.Q.

<details>

<summary>
  What is the _global_unique_id field for barcodes?
</summary>

The `_global_unique_id` field is a new barcode field that WooCommerce recently added to provide better barcode standardization across stores.

**Key Points:**

- **Modern Standard**: This field was designed specifically for global barcode identification
- **POS Configuration**: You can configure the POS to use `_global_unique_id` as the barcode field in the POS settings
- **Legacy vs. New**: The legacy barcode setting uses the `_sku` field, but this will change to `_global_unique_id` in future versions
- **Flexibility**: You can configure any product meta field as your barcode field if you're using third-party barcode plugins
- **Future Default**: `_global_unique_id` will become the default barcode field in future POS updates

To configure which field the POS uses for barcodes, visit your POS settings in the WordPress admin area.

<summary>
  Why don't I see all my products when I search?
</summary>

WooCommerce POS uses progressive product downloading to maintain performance. If you don't see a product:

1. **Try searching for it** - This will trigger the POS to look for it on your server
2. **Wait for download** - The POS will download the product and others in small batches
3. **Search again** - Once downloaded, the product will appear in future searches

This process ensures your POS remains fast and responsive even with thousands of products. Learn more about this in our [Product Synchronisation](./sync) guide.

<details>

<summary>
  Can I search for partial product names or SKUs?
</summary>

Yes! The tokenized search uses forward matching, which means:

- Searching "blue" will find products with "blueberry", "blue shirt", etc.
- Searching "ABC" will find SKUs like "ABC123", "ABC-XYZ", etc.
- You don't need to type complete words or codes

The search is designed to find products quickly with minimal typing.
