description: If your web host blocks modern RESTful HTTP methods you will need to enable legacy server support.

HTTP (and HTTPS) are the protocols used by every browser to talk to web applications.
A key part of the protocol is the [HTTP method](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.1).
Traditionally, web applications used a very limited set of HTTP methods such as GET (retrieve a web page) and POST (submit a web form).

Modern web applications, such as WooCommerce POS, use a REST/HTTP approach with following HTTP Methods:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

In some rare cases a web host may choose to block some of these HTTP methods.
If your web host blocks modern RESTful HTTP methods you will need to enable legacy server support.
