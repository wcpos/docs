I noticed that while you started to provide documentation to translate, the actual content wasn't included in your message. Could you share the specific MDX documentation you'd like me to translate to Spanish? I'll be happy to help you translate it following the guidelines of preserving formatting, code blocks, links, and translating the appropriate frontmatter fields.
