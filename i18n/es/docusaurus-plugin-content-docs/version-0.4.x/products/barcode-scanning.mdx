The following features are being planned for future releases:

- Add products to WooCommerce using barcode scanner. This will be part of a stocktake mode being planned for a 0.3.x release.
- Barcode scanning using mobile device camera. This will require a native WooCommerce POS app to gain access to the device hardware. Native apps are on the wish list but adding features toÂ the web version is the highest priority at the moment.
- Hot key activation

**Since Version 0.3.1:** There is now a dedicated mode for Barcode scanning. You can switch between 'Search' mode and 'Scan Barcode' by clicking on the button to the left of the search field.
