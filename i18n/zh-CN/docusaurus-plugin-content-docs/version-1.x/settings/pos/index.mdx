import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

The POS application has multiple layers of settings:

## [Store Settings](/settings/pos/store)

These settings are used to configure the overall behaviour and preferences of the React Native application. They are accessible via:

The User Menu (top-right corner dropdown) or by using the `Ctrl + Shift + S` hotkey.

Examples of main store settings:

- Language & Currency.
- Barcode scanner settings.

## [Section Settings](/settings/pos/section)

Each data table in the POS application has its own configurable settings, accessible within the respective table. These settings allow for:

- Hiding or showing columns.
- Adjusting display options.
- Customising features specific to that data table.

By separating settings into these categories, you can easily locate and adjust configurations based on your requirements.
