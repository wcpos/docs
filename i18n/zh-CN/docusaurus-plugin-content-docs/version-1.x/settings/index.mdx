The POS application consists of two parts:

- A PHP WordPress Plugin.
- A cross-platform React Native Application.

To avoid confusion, this guide clarifies where and how to access and configure each type of setting.

## [Settings in the WordPress Admin](/settings/wp-admin)

These settings configure the backend functionality of the POS application, including PHP and WooCommerce configurations. 
You can access them by navigating to: `WP Admin > POS > Settings`

Key configurations include:

- Default cart customer for all cashiers.
- Product barcode field.
- Order email settings.
- User role permissions.

## [Settings in the POS Application](/settings/pos)

The POS application has multiple layers of settings:

### [Store Settings](/settings/pos/store)

These settings are used to configure the overall behaviour and preferences of the React Native application. They are accessible via:

The User Menu (top-right corner dropdown) or by using the `Ctrl + Shift + S` hotkey.

Examples of main store settings:

- Language & Currency.
- Barcode scanner settings.

### [Section Settings](/settings/pos/section)

Each data table in the POS application has its own configurable settings, accessible within the respective table. These settings allow for:

- Hiding or showing columns.
- Adjusting display options.
- Customising features specific to that data table.

By separating settings into these categories, you can easily locate and adjust configurations based on your requirements.
