import Gist from "@site/src/components/Gist";

The POS receipt print templates reside in the `includes/views/print/tmpl-receipt.php` file of both the free and the Pro plugins. Receipt templates can be customised by creating a `woocommerce-pos/print/tmpl-receipt.php` file in your theme directory. The code for both templates is included below.

### Basic Receipt Template

<Gist id="04b4a4f1c2792b4efff5" />

### Pro Receipt Template

The Pro Receipt Template allows additional information from the [Stores](./stores) admin such as logo, store address, opening hours and special messages.

### Customising the receipt date

WCPOS uses [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to localise the date strings. The default date format is `"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a"`, eg: May 31st 2015, 7:20:44 pm. Please consult the [moment.js documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) for more information on customising the date format.

### Order Properties

WCPOS uses the json output from the WC REST API to populate the order receipt template. [The WC REST API docs show an example](http://woothemes.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#view-an-order) of the standard json output. Some additional properties have been added by WCPOS using the `woocommerce_api_order_response` filter.
