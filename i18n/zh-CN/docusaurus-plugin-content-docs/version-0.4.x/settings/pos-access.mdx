Using the POS Access settings, store owners can grant or remove user privileges to the Point of Sale system.
By default, the roles **Administrator** and **Shop Manager** are enabled with all capabilities for using the POS.
It is recommended you keep the default settings unless you are aware of the consequences.
For example, granting the `publish_shop_orders` to the `Subscribers` role would be a _very_ bad idea.
